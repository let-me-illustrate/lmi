$(error MSYS environment no longer supported--use Cygwin instead)

# MSYS !! IMPORTANT NOTES.
#
# MSYS poses certain problems that must be worked around carefully.
# These problems have been confirmed with MSYS-1.0.10 of 2004-05,
# the latest "release" as of 2006-01. Studying this comment block
# assiduously will save you time. Rereading it when something goes
# wrong will also save you time.
#
# Its sed dates from 1998 and can't handle modern usage. It must be
# replaced as follows:
#  - Get the GNU sources for sed-4.0.7 (tested) or later (untested).
#  - Build a new msw binary in MSYS with './configure && make'.
#  - Copy it to MSYS path '$(system_root)/usr/bin/sed' to use the
#    definition of $(SED) below (or supply your own definition).
#
# Do not copy this new sed binary into MSYS's own /bin/ or /usr/bin/
# directories: that would certainly cause horrible problems. Hesitate
# to place any file there: read the cautions in MSYS's /doc/msys/* .
# Don't read '/doc/msys/README.rtf' alone and skip the rest: this
# particular pitfall is documented in '/doc/msys/MSYS_WELCOME.rtf'.
# Don't replace or delete the MSYS-provided '/bin/sed': that would
# break your MSYS installation for packages that can use that ancient
# version of sed.
#
# Replacing sed exposes a nasty problem in MSYS's bash port, which
# "translates" any program argument it deems to be a path; details:
#   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.mingw.msys/2183
#     [2005-01-27T01:42:19Z from Greg Chicares]
# That problem has been worked around by changing sed commands
# throughout the lmi makefiles in benign but ridiculous ways.
#
# If you modify MSYS's '/etc/fstab', end each line with '\n', and
# don't insert any '\r' or use any editor that will do that. Check
# your work carefully with 'od -t a /etc/fstab'.
#
# Don't ever use any path with embedded spaces anywhere.
#
# Don't attempt to mix cygwin and MSYS tools. Don't permit $PATH to
# point to one when you want to use the other.
#
# Use this command
#   echo '"\e[3~": delete-char' >>~/.inputrc
# to make the Delete key work.

# Set normal system paths explicitly unless $(USE_STD_PATHS) is specified.
# Reason: many problems reported on mailing lists are due to users mixing
# MSYS and cygwin tools by setting $(PATH) incorrectly; but people who set
# $(USE_STD_PATHS) are assumed to know what they're doing. These paths are
# slash-terminated so that setting them to empty strings works, too.

# MSYS mounts /usr/bin/ as an alias for /bin/ , so it's irrelevant that
# it places files that belong in /usr/bin/ physically in its /bin/ . This
