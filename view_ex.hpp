// This is a derived work based on wxWindows file
//   samples/docvwmdi/view.cpp (C) 1998 Julian Smart and Markus Holzem
// which is covered by the wxWindows license.
//
// The original was modified by GWC in 2004 to create an abstract
// enhanced view class, and in the later years given in the copyright
// notice above.

// Enhance class wxView to encapsulate things that are naturally
// associated with each concrete derived class and implement common
// behavior that is assumed to be generally appropriate.

// Clients can use any child window type in CreateChildWindow(). That
// type could instead have been made a template parameter of this
// class. That design alternative would seem preferable if all child
// windows were created the same way, or if the child-window type were
// otherwise useful in this class, but neither of those conditions
// seems to obtain.

// Icon() and MenuBar() return types suitable for passing to wx
// functions SetIcon() and SetMenuBar() respectively. Because they are
// expected to be loaded from xml resources, the functions could have
// been made nonvirtual, with a string argument to distinguish view
// types, and indeed protected functions IconFromXmlResource() and
// MenuBarFromXmlResource() are provided to encapsulate that work in
// this class--with the same return types as the wxxrc functions they
// call. Thus, notably, MenuBarFromXmlResource() returns a pointer,
// but it never returns a null pointer, which would cause the program
// to crash--instead, it returns a default object if no menubar can be
// read from an xml resource. The public functions are pure to allow
// implementation flexibility. For instance, an overrider may contain
// a static variable to cache xml resources for better responsiveness,
// or it may use a different approach altogether.

// OnCreate() and OnClose() are implemented here because it is not
// anticipated that their essential behavior would differ in client
// classes. Small differences can be factored into pure functions:
// for instance, OnCreate() calls CreateChildWindow().

// TODO ?? Revise the preceding comment.

// OnDraw() is pure in base class wxView. An (empty) implementation is
// supplied here because no view class in the application this is
// designed for actually needs to implement it.

// FrameWindow() is a convenience function that returns a reference to
// a wxFrame. Member functions specific to wxFrame cannot be called
// through wxView::GetFrame() without casting because it returns a
// wxWindow*.

// TODO ?? No provision is yet made here for updating views when
// document data changes; wx provides some functions for that.
