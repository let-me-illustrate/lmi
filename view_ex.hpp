// This is a derived work based on wxWindows file
//   samples/docvwmdi/view.cpp (C) 1998 Julian Smart and Markus Holzem
// which is covered by the wxWindows license.
//
// The original was modified by GWC in 2004 to create an abstract
// enhanced view class, and in the later years given in the copyright
// notice above.

// Enhance class wxView to encapsulate things that are naturally
// associated with each concrete derived class and implement common
// behavior that is assumed to be generally appropriate.

// Clients can use any child window type in CreateChildWindow(). That
// type could instead have been made a template parameter of this
// class. That design alternative would seem preferable if all child
// windows were created the same way, or if the child-window type were
// otherwise useful in this class, but neither of those conditions
// seems to obtain.

// Icon() and MenuBar() return types suitable for passing to wx
// functions SetIcon() and SetMenuBar() respectively. These nonvirtual
// functions call virtuals that load XRC resources. Private functions
// IconFromXmlResource() and MenuBarFromXmlResource() encapsulate that
// work; they have the same return types as the wxxrc functions they
// call. Thus, notably, MenuBarFromXmlResource() returns a pointer,
// but it never returns a null pointer, which would cause the program
// to crash--instead, it returns a default object if no menubar can be
// read from an XRC resource. SOMEDAY !! Should these public functions
// cache XRC resources in a static variable for better responsiveness?

// OnClose() is implemented here because it is not anticipated that
// its essential behavior would differ in client classes.

// OnCreate() has a default implementation, in DoOnCreate(), which is
// suitable for many client classes; others call DoOnCreate() in their
// implementations. DoOnCreate() calls CreateChildWindow(), which is a
// pure function because clients create different window types.

// OnDraw() is pure in base class wxView. An (empty) implementation is
// supplied here because no view class in the application this is
// designed for actually needs to implement it.

// FrameWindow() is a convenience function that returns a reference to
// a wxFrame. Member functions specific to wxFrame cannot be called
// through wxView::GetFrame() without casting because it returns a
// wxWindow*.
