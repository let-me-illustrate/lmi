/// references in it with the value of the variable as returned by the provided
/// function. The syntax is a subset of Mustache templates with the following
/// features being are supported:
///  - Recursive variable expansion for {{variable}}, i.e. -- unlike in
///    Mustache -- any {{...}} in the returned expansion are expanded again.
///  - Conditional expansion using {{#variable}}...{{/variable}}.
///  - Negated checks of the form {{^variable}}...{{/variable}}.
///  - Partials support, i.e. {{>filename}}.
///  - Comments of the form {{!this is ignored}}.
///
/// The following features are explicitly _not_ supported:
///  - HTML escaping: this is done by a separate html::text class.
///  - Separate types: 0/1 is false/true, anything else is an error.
///  - Lists/section iteration (not needed yet).
///  - Lambdas: can't be implemented in non-dynamic languages such as C++.
///  - Changing delimiters: omitted for simplicity (to allow embedding literal
///    "{{" fragment into the returned string, create a pseudo-variable
///    expanding to these characters).
///
/// Throw if the lookup function throws, if the string uses invalid syntax or
/// if the maximum recursion level is exceeded.
