// Gregory W. Chicares modified it in 2004 to make it independent of
// the boost directory structure, and in any other ways indicated
// below, and in any later years shown above. Any defect in it should
// not reflect on Beman Dawes's reputation.

// The original boost.org test library upon which this derived work is
// based was later replaced by a very different library. That new test
// library has more features but is less transparent; it is not
// strictly compatible with tests written for the original library;
// and, for boost-1.31.0 at least, it didn't work out of the box with
// the latest como compiler. The extra features don't seem to be worth
// the cost.
//
// It seems unwise to mix boost versions, and better to extract this
// library from boost-1.23.0 and remove its dependencies on other
// parts of boost, which is easy to do because, as Beman Dawes says:
// Header dependencies are deliberately restricted to reduce coupling.

// This file may be included as a header file, or may be compiled and placed
// in a library for traditional linking. It is unusual for non-template
// non-inline implementation code to be used as a header file, but the user
// may elect to do so because header-only implementation requires no library
// build support. (Suggested by Ed Brey)

    // for versatility and clarity.
    //
    // Rationale: An alternative implementation of LMI_TEST_THROW
    // was written to determine how much work could be delegated to
    // functions without reporting less information. Because the
    // 'expression' parameter can be a simple semicolon, it must be a
    // macro parameter. Therefore, the try-block that encloses it must
    // be written in the macro, and, consequently, so must the
    // associated catch-clause. Only the reporting can be delegated to
    // functions. Three such functions were written, because three
    // different types of errors can occur. Understanding this design
    // required looking back and forth between an irreducibly complex
    // macro in one file and three function implementations in another
    // file, and writing the function invocations in the macro took
    // about as much space as inlining the code.
    //
    // OTOH, comparing the expected to the observed what() string is
    // simpler in an auxiliary function: that function, whats_what(),
    // is more readable than the inlined macro code it replaced, and
    // easier to overload.

    std::ostream& error_stream();

    // Increment test_tools_successes counter.
    void record_success();

    // Increment test_tools_errors counter.
    void record_error();
} // namespace lmi_test

// For convenience, include lower-level layers. (The original boost
// library did this only if BOOST_INCLUDE_MAIN had been defined.)

#include "cpp_main.cpp"
#include "test_main.cpp"

// Withdrawn macros.
//
// Macros BOOST_ERROR, BOOST_CRITICAL_ERROR, and BOOST_CRITICAL_TEST,
// formerly provided, have been withdrawn because they were never
// really useful. In boost-1.23.0, except for the testing framework's
// own unit tests, BOOST_ERROR and BOOST_CRITICAL_ERROR are used only
// once each and only in a single file, in the idiom
//   if(condition) {macro;}
// where
//   BOOST_TEST(condition);
// or
//   BOOST_CRITICAL_TEST(condition);
// would be more natural. BOOST_CRITICAL_TEST is used more often in
// boost-1.23.0, but, except for the testing framework's own unit
// tests, it occurs only in files whose authors don't use BOOST_TEST,
// where it seems that BOOST_TEST would be better. Probably BOOST_TEST
// is always better: if the success of a particular test is thought to
// be a precondition for success of all later tests, it's not clearly
// a good idea to skip the later tests--if any of them succeed, that's
// interesting.
