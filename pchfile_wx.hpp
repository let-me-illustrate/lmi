// In every '.cpp' file that is expected to benefit from precompiled
// headers, include exactly one of these PCH headers:
//   pchfile.hpp    // For TUs included in a non-wx-dependent library
//   pchfile_wx.hpp // For TUs included in a     wx-dependent library
// Include it before anything else except comments and whitespace.
// Never include any PCH header in any other file.

// Rationale for reverse include guards: see 'config*.hpp'.

#ifndef pchfile_wx_hpp
#define pchfile_wx_hpp

// Even if precompiled headers are not really being used, use this header to
// disable some warnings which are enabled for the rest of lmi code but have to
// be disabled for the code using wxWidgets as they occur in wxWidgets headers.
