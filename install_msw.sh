# A command such as
#   mkdir --parents /cygdrive/c/opt/lmi/src/lmi
# has the perverse effect of creating 'C:\cygwin\cygdrive'. To avoid
# that problem, '/opt' is first mounted, then unmounted.
#
# Don't remove the '/opt' directory from Cygwin's filesystem. Other
# programs may want to use it. Furthermore, if it were removed, then
# shell completion, e.g., '/op' [tab], wouldn't work.

# Use 'pserver' unless 'ssh-agent' is active. This helps developers
# who are behind a firewall that blocks port 2401 but allows 'ssh'
# access. It is assumed that they have pointed $CVSROOT to
#   cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/lmi
# as is usual, and that they will switch back there manually after
# running this script.
#
# As a last resort, a screen scraper could be used, e.g.
#   http://downloads.sourceforge.net/cvsgrab/cvsgrab-2.3.tar.gz
# with a command line such as this:
#   /cvsgrab-2.3/cvsgrab.sh \
#     -url http://cvs.sv.gnu.org/viewvc/lmi/lmi/ \
#     -destDir cvsgrab \
#     -webInterface ViewVC1_0
# Unfortunately, that 'cvsgrab' command adds '-kb' to every file, so
# developers should take care not to use it.
