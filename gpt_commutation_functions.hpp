/// conversion from annual to monthly, subject to some maximum or
/// minimum--so leaving them out makes const objects of this class
/// potentially more useful.
///
/// Vector parameters run from issue age through the 7702(e)(1)(B)

/// They are assumed to include any applicable rating, such as an
/// occupational extra on an accident benefit.

/// Term rates on the main insured ('qab_term_rate') apply only to
/// coverage not treated as "death benefit"; decreasing term is
/// treated here as level.

/// private members, without protecting it better against accidental

/// See section 14.3 here:
///   http://www.nongnu.org/lmi/7702.html
///
/// Only these specialized functions are needed. Once they're set, the
/// canonical commutation functions {C,D,N} from which they're derived
/// can be discarded. The function M is retained because it is used in
/// an unspecialized form. The value of D at the endowment duration is
/// kept for valuing the endowment benefit; it may at first seem that
/// it could be subsumed into M, but it is always multiplied by the
/// specified amount, whereas M may be multiplied by death benefit.
///
/// Vector parameters run from issue age through the 7702(e)(1)(B)
/// maturity age (thus, neither issue nor maturity age is needed).
/// They are assumed to include any applicable rating, such as an
/// occupational extra on an accident benefit.
///
/// QABs are enumerated in 7702(f)(5)(i-iv). The benefit amounts by
/// which their rates are multiplied are all specified explicitly.
/// This uniform approach is the most general, and entails little
/// duplication in the case that the QAB rate is multiplied by the
/// specified amount, as frequently occurs with accident and waiver
/// benefits. A waiver benefit whose charge depends on actual monthly
/// deductions cannot be treated as a QAB--see section 11/7 here:
///   http://www.nongnu.org/lmi/7702.html
/// A vector of zeros may of course be passed as the rate vector for
/// any QAB that is not offered or not elected, or that the insurer
/// chooses not to treat as a QAB.
///
/// Data member 'length_' is a dispensable convenience that makes
/// initialization and precondition checks a little clearer.
