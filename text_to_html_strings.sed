# Replace certain special characters with html entities as required
# for the output to be valid html. This script does not attempt to
# handle quotes or dashes more tastefully than its input: that would
# be complex and error prone.

# Add a generic html header and footer. Implementation notes:
#
# The header and footer must be quoted for use as C strings. It seems
# unnatural to do that manually here instead of using the reliable
# commands applied below to the input. Therefore, sed's 'a' and 'i'
# commands cannot be used to insert the header and footer, because
# the text they add is queued directly for output to stdout and
# cannot be processed further.
#
# The header is inserted through substitutions on the first line.
# It would seem simpler to insert '\n' before each line of text
# inserted, but that would insert the lines in reverse order, and
# reversing the order in which they occur in this script to make it
# come out right would make the script difficult to read. Therefore,
# '\a' is used as a temporary sentry to mark the end of the text
# inserted at each step.
#
# Page break support using CSS2 requires html version 4. Version 4.01
# is used instead of 4.0, as w3c.org recommends.
#
# A title tag is required inside the head tag, but there's no good
# way to specify a non-empty title automatically.

# Add generic header.
