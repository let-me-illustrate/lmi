# Invoke as ". /opt/lmi/src/lmi/set_toolchain.sh" without the quotes.
#
# $LMI_COMPILER and $LMI_TRIPLET are set to default values currently
# used in production if they were unset or null beforehand. They can
# be overridden at the command line, e.g.:
#
#   LMI_COMPILER=gcc ; LMI_TRIPLET=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu ; . /opt/lmi/src/lmi/set_toolchain.sh
#   LMI_COMPILER=gcc ; LMI_TRIPLET=i686-w64-mingw32    ; . /opt/lmi/src/lmi/set_toolchain.sh
#   LMI_COMPILER=gcc ; LMI_TRIPLET=x86_64-w64-mingw32  ; . /opt/lmi/src/lmi/set_toolchain.sh
#
# Implemented as a function that runs and then erases itself, so that
# sourcing this script changes the environment only as intended. This
# depends on 'local', which isn't yet POSIX, though there's a proposal
# to add it:
#   http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=767
# 'dash' and 'ash' already have 'local', so, while it's not yet POSIX,
# it's used here, and its 'shellcheck' warning is disabled:
# shellcheck disable=SC2039,SC3043

# Unimplemented alternative: Variables such as $prefix could be made
# similarly overridable, along with other directories--perhaps even
# platform-specific ones like $mingw_bin_dir.

# Unimplemented alternative: use symlinks, e.g:
#   ln --symbolic --force --no-dereference \
#   /opt/lmi/"${LMI_COMPILER}_${LMI_TRIPLET}"/bin /opt/lmi/bin
# and likewise for all other directories. Depending on symlinks
# didn't seem like a good idea.

# This alternative for future consideration trades some complexity of
# implementation for mitigation of confusion and convenience of use.
#
# To cross-build autotoolized libraries, configure with:
#   --host=$LMI_TRIPLET
#   --exec_prefix=$prefix/$LMI_TOOLCHAIN
# where
#   LMI_TOOLCHAIN=${LMI_COMPILER}_${LMI_TRIPLET}
#
# Supported values:
#   LMI_COMPILER : gcc, clang
#   LMI_TRIPLET  : x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, i686-w64-mingw32, x86_64-w64-mingw32
# (clang not yet tested).
#
# Examples:
#
#  LMI_TOOLCHAIN  LMI_COMPILER  ----------LMI_TRIPLET----------
#                               cpu     -vendor -[kernel-]system
#
#      gcc_msw32       gcc      i686    -w64            -mingw32
#      gcc_msw64       gcc      x86_64  -w64            -mingw32
#    clang_gnu64      clang     x86_64  -pc     -linux  -gnu
#
# Rationale: Triplets are required for selecting cross compilers. GNU
# triplets are in widespread use, although debian uses its own:
#   https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/Tuples#Why_not_use_GNU_triplets.3F
# The main reason for lmi to establish its own is that the official
# triplets for msw are so poor. For example, "i686-w64-mingw32" has
# substrings "64" and "32". Both seem to specify the CPU's word size
# (contradicting each other), but actually neither does--the word size
# is determined by the "i686" field. See:
#   https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=622276
