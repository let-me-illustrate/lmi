/// Motivating example: wx_test_exception derives from this class.
/// The production system (distributed to end users) is tested by
/// running its code under the supervision of the 'wx_test' program
/// (which is for developer use only)--in which case 'wx_test'
/// invokes the production code (replacing only its main() function)
/// and tests simulated GUI events. For this sole, exclusive purpose,
/// wx_test_exception is needed--and must pass through the production
/// code's exception traps as a neutrino through a fishing net. In any
/// other situation, it undermines the
///   catch(...) {report_exception();}
/// idiom, potentially causing great harm; to forestall that, a ctor
/// is declared here, but implemented only in the 'wx_test' code.
///
/// Implicitly-declared special member functions do the right thing.

/// Handle an uncaught exception, showing a description if available
/// readily through what(), with the following idiomatic usage:
///   catch(...) {report_exception();}
/// which makes it possible to write generic exception-handling code
/// once and only once. See:
///   http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/msg/7ac8db2c59c34103
///
/// Simply rethrow when stealth_exception is caught: see the comments
/// accompanying its declaration. To catch even stealth_exception and
/// classes derived from it--for instance, in a main() function, where
/// an untrapped exception would cause a crash--write:
///   catch(...) { try{report_exception();} catch(...){/*warning*/} }
///
/// Show no message when hobsons_choice_exception is caught--just
/// swallow it silently. It's thrown only when
///  - an appropriate message was just shown, and then
///  - the safe default action (throwing this exception) was accepted,
/// in which case it's pointless to repeat the same message.
///
/// It may seem like a good idea to test std::uncaught_exception()
/// right before the try block, as recommended here:
///   http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/msg/ec0ef69dd3949955
///   "Before the try-block in report_exception, query
///   std::uncaught_exception() to determine if an exception is
///   active. If it is not, throw std::logic_error or some exception
///   that you know that your framework will catch."
/// but actually that's invalid--see:
///   http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/msg/aa7ce713ee90c044
///   "The only problem with uncaught_exception is that it doesn't
///   tell you when you're in a catch(...) { ... throw; } block"
///
/// See
