/// Numerical algorithms for stratified rates.
///
/// Definitions: the functors in this library distinguish 'tiered' from
/// 'banded' rates and values. The vernacular lacks precise terms for
/// these two important and distinct concepts, so those and other terms
/// are given special definitions here.
///
/// 'bracket': A row in a schedule of rates such as this:
///
///        cumulative
///   rate   limit
///   0.05    1000    <-- first  bracket: [   0, 1000)
///   0.02    5000    <-- second bracket: [1000, 5000)
///   0.01 infinity   <-- third  bracket: [5000, infinity)
///
/// Limits are constrained to be positive and nondecreasing. The first
/// bracket extends from zero (implicitly) to the first limit. The last
/// limit must have no finite upper bound in the real number system; in
/// computer floating point, it's specified as DBL_MAX.
///
/// It is convenient to characterize brackets by their upper limits.
/// Brackets may also be characterized in terms of incremental rather
/// than cumulative limits: {1000, 4000, infinity} are the incremental
/// limits for this schedule.
///
/// Consider two different ways of applying that schedule of rates to
/// amounts of 900, 1500, and 10000.
///
/// 'tiered': A succession of rates applies incrementally to a
/// progressive series of slices that partition the full amount.
///     900 -->  45 = 0.05 *  900
///    1500 -->  60 = 0.05 * 1000 + 0.02 * (1500 - 1000)
///   10000 --> 180 = 0.05 * 1000 + 0.02 * (5000 - 1000) + 0.01 * (10000 - 5000)
/// Here, the function is continuous, and also monotonically increasing
/// (x <= y ==> f(x) <= f(y)) if the rates are all nonnegative and the
/// limits increasing, as is typically the case.
///
/// 'banded': A single scalar rate applies to the full amount.
///     900 -->  45 = 0.05 *   900
///    1500 -->  30 = 0.02 *  1500
///   10000 --> 100 = 0.01 * 10000
/// Here, 1500 is above the first limit, but below the second limit,
/// so it's in the second bracket. The second rate is applied to the
/// entire amount of 1500. The function is not monotone except in the
/// degenerate case of uniformly equal rates.

// TODO ?? Shortcomings:
//
// 'TieredGrossToNet' and 'TieredNetToGross' lack unit tests and
// probably should be template functions.
//
// Inline comments point out several specific defects.
//
// Documentation could be improved.
//
// TieredGrossToNet() and TieredNetToGross() seem to be two-bracket

//
// 'tiered_product' and 'tiered_rate' masquerade as binary functions,

// instances if binary functions are really needed, but probably it
// would be better not to derive from std::binary_function at all.
//
// 'tiered' and 'banded' limits are expressed differently: as
// incremental and cumulative limits, respectively. This may confuse
// the careless reader, but presents limits to the product-editor user
// in the least astonishing way.

/// Motivation: Universal life insurance policies, in the general form

/// Periodic deductions must be apportioned between these two types of
/// accounts. Most often, deductions are taken in proportion to the
/// balance in each account, but this routine instead supports a
/// different approach that prefers to take all deductions, to the
/// extent possible, from the account designated by the first argument
/// (the 'preferred' account).
///
/// In the simplest and most common case, both funds are positive, as
/// is the deduction, and the deduction is taken from the preferred
/// account until it is depleted (becomes zero), any remainder being
/// taken from the other account until it is depleted, and any final
/// remainder becoming the return value. In this case, neither account
/// is made negative here. If the return value is not zero, then the
/// calling function might debit it from a distinct 'deficit' account,
/// or from one of the accounts given here as arguments; that operation
/// is not performed here because it would complicate this routine and
/// make it less flexible--for instance, the return value might be
/// debited downstream from either the preferred or the other account,
/// and this routine doesn't need to know which.
///
/// Accordingly, there is no restriction on the sign of either account-
/// balance argument. (Probably it's impossible for a separate account
/// to have a negative balance, but this routine doesn't know which
/// argument that might be.) And the sign of delta is unrestricted in
/// order to accommodate negative charges, which may conceivably arise:
/// for instance, a loan normally occasions a reduction, and it may be
/// convenient to treat a loan repayment as a negative reduction.
///
/// In this more general sign-unrestricted case, any negative balance
/// must first be increased to zero if possible. Consider:
///     0 separate account (argument a--the preferred account)
///   -10 general account  (argument b)
///   -30 delta (a negative delta is a positive increment)
/// The preference order suggests debiting -30 (crediting 30) to the
/// separate account, but the general account must first be increased
/// to zero, resulting in
///    20 separate account
///     0 general account
///     0 return value
/// In the situation
///   -20 separate account (argument a--the preferred account)
///   -10 general account  (argument b)
///   -25 delta (a negative delta is a positive increment)
/// the preferred account would first be brought to zero, then the
/// other account would be made as nonnegative as possible, with result
///     0 separate account
///    -5 general account
///     0 return value
/// [Note: The alternative of forcing both accounts to be nonnegative,
/// transforming input
///   -20 argument a
///   -10 argument b
///     0 delta
/// into output
///     0 argument a
///     0 argument b
///   -30 return value
/// was considered and rejected because it destroys information.
/// The predisposition to suppose that one of the arguments represents
/// a separate account that can never be negative was considered an
