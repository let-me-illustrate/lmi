    The header is split in two parts, upper and lower one, only to allow
    inserting the title between them, as a couple of pages do. But we still
    provide this "full header" template for the pages that don't have any
    title to make them simpler.

    PDF !! The title that's inserted in between can be moved after the header,
    which then won't need to be split in two parts.
