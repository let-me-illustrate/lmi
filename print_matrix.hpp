/// Print a matrix more or less as APL would.
///
/// Treat any dimension of length one as though it didn't exist.
///
/// Preserve decimal floating-point precision to the extent possible
/// while suppressing artifacts that would confuse the human reader.
/// For example, show 1.07 as "1.07", not "1.0700000000000001".
///
/// It is anticipated that the result will often be pasted into a
/// spreadsheet. Therefore, formatted data are delimited by tabs
/// (when not by newlines).
///
/// No effort is yet made to align data regularly.
///
/// Motivation: Entities in the lmi product database are essentially
/// seven-dimensional matrices, most axes being of length one. There
/// is no more natural way to print them than the way APL would.
///
/// Illustration of algorithm: Data are printed sequentially (as
/// though "ravelled", as one would say in APL); the only interesting
/// question is where to insert newlines. For a 2 by 3 by 5 matrix,
/// construct a vector of moduli {30, 15, 5} by reversed cumulative
/// multiplication. After the Nth datum (in index origin one), the
/// number of newlines to be written is clearly the inner product of
/// N modulo that vector. I have an expression of this in just a few
/// APL characters, which this character set is too small to contain.
///
/// Future directions: Consider adding labels for each hyperplane.
/// Consider returning a string instead of writing directly to a
/// std::ostream.
