/// A census represented as an xml document.
///
/// The document is composed of three vectors of class Input.
///
/// cell_parms_: parameters for each cell. There are one or more
/// cells. Each represents one illustration. An illustration depicts
/// projected values for a particular life-insurance policy. Usually
/// it corresponds to a concrete person. However, a large, unwieldy
/// census may for simplicity be approximated by a small number of
/// representative cells: e.g., 100 35-year-olds, 250 45-year-olds,
/// and so on, using Input::NumberOfIdenticalLives to specify the
/// number of people in each subgroup. That is why the abstract name
/// "cell" is used here.
///
/// These cells are what the census manager displays. They encompass
/// all the particular illustrations that can be produced from the
/// census. A composite illustration can also be produced: it is the
/// sum of all particular illustrations, weighted by the number of
/// identical lives in each cell.
///
/// case_parms_: default parameters for the whole census. This is
/// somewhat artificially stored as a vector for parallelism with
/// class_parms_ and cell_parms_, but this vector by its nature must
/// always have exactly one element. It serves as a template embodying
/// parameters that are common to all cells. When a new cell is added
/// in the census manager, that new cell is copied from this default.
/// To change one or more parameters across all cells, users modify
/// the default cell and propagate the changes to all cells (and to
/// all class defaults--vide infra).
///
/// class_parms_: default parameters for each employee class. A census
/// may be partitioned into "classes" using Input::EmployeeClass; for
/// example, it may contain two classes: "Managers" whose specified
/// amount is two times salary, and "Workers" who get a flat $50,000.
/// To increase the amount for "Workers" to $75,000, users modify the
/// appropriate class default and propagate the changes to all cells.
/// Because Input::EmployeeClass is simply a string, the number of
/// classes is boundless, and each cell belongs to exactly one class.
/// When a new cell is added in the census manager, it inherits the
/// case-default employee class; users have not asked for a command to
/// add a new cell copied from a selection of class defaults, although
/// that could of course be implemented.
