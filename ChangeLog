Please write entries this way:

[1] YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ <yourname@domain.net> [defect-count]
[2] [this line intentionally left blank]
[3]   filename0
[4]   filename1
[5] Terse comments: full English sentences beginning with a capital
    letter and ending with a period. Prefer bare infinitives:
    "Improve ISO 8601 conformance." instead of "Improved...." or
    "The purpose of this change was to improve....". Single-word
    sentences may be appropriate: "Refactor.". Whenever a defect is
    corrected, write "Fix defect introduced YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ." as the
    first sentence, and ponder the questions in 'DefectLog'; write up
    any serious defect in that file.

Limit lines to seventy characters so that they can be quoted and
requoted in email without wrapping.

Explanations:

[1] Write an ISO 8601 timestamp, using UTC because it sorts easily.
Use the actual commit time, so that others can confidently match log
entries against cvs changes. Run 'make check_concinnity' before
committing to cvs: it identifies common problems such as incorrect
copyright statements, and reports the "Number of marked defects" shown
as [defect-count] above.

[3] Exact name of file changed, indented two spaces.

[4] Write each file's name on a separate line, in ASCII sort order:
the same order 'ls' uses, where 'Z' precedes 'a'.

[5] We aren't exactly following GNU standards here, but this one makes
a lot of sense:
  "If you think that a change calls for explanation, you're probably
  right. Please do explain it--but please put the explanation in
  comments in the code, where people will see it whenever they see the
  code."
If, as is often the case, the cvs commit message alone is sufficient,
then just copy it here.

We started following certain conventions only at certain times, e.g.:
  20050710T0414Z: [defect-count]
  20070803T2333Z: "Fix defect introduced YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ."
so don't take earlier entries as exemplary.

Original checkin.

2005-01-15

  actuarial_table.cpp
  crc32.cpp
  crc32_test.cpp
  data_directory.cpp
  ihs_proddata.cpp
Remove carriage returns.

  elapsed_time.cpp
  system_command.cpp
  system_command.hpp
Add missing RCS Id.

2005-01-16

  sample_cgi_census
Expunge this file, which was a disused artifact.

  build.hpp
  expected.cgi.out
  version.hpp
Add copyright and license notices and RCS Ids to these files, no
matter how trivial they seem. Now every single file in this cvs
directory has these things, creating an invariant that can be
confirmed automatically.

2005-01-27 [1092]

  quoted_gpl
  quoted_gpl_html
Add automatically-generated files for embedding the GPL in other
source, as quoted C strings and html respectively.

  GNUmakefile
  autodependency.make
  configuration.make
  msw_common.make
  msw_cygwin.make
  msw_generic.make
  msw_msys.make
  objects.make
  posix_fhs.make
  workhorse.make
Add makefiles.

2005-01-28 [1104]

Changes necessary to compile with gcc-3.4.2 with no diagnostics:

  config.hpp
  platform_dependent.hpp
Make prototypes of nonstandard functions like putenv() available even
in strict standard-conformance mode.

  GNUmakefile
  argv0.hpp
  diagnostics.sed
  miscellany.hpp
  quiet_nan.hpp
  zero.hpp
All non-configuration headers must include "config.hpp" first. Fix
those that didn't. Add a makefile test for this invariant; refine
other such tests slightly, and improve the sed script that parses
makefile output for diagnostics.

  alert.cpp
Remove a defect marker that called for investigation into a problem
whose cause has been tracked to a libstdc++ defect.

  library_demo.cpp
Don't enforce production-grade security for this mere demo.

  financial_test.cpp
Run timing test once only: it took too long with mpatrol.

  security.cpp
Flush message log on passkey validation failure.

  ledger_xml_io.cpp
  round_to_test.cpp
  rounding_rules.hpp
  streamable.hpp
  system_command.hpp
  zero.hpp
  zero_test.cpp
Fix other problems diagnosed by gcc-3.4.2, which is stricter than
earlier versions. Use import and export declspec attributes wherever
they make sense: even though it's better not to use them with msw,
they may be useful with gcc-4.x's ELF 'visibility' feature. Remove
superfluous class-name qualifiers from members defined in class
bodies. Factor out duplicative code to manage the floating-point
environment. Other minor changes to improve conformance.

Unit tests do not yet run properly with gcc-3.4.2 and mpatrol, so that
newer compiler version can't yet replace gcc-3.2.3 for production.
However, these changes affect no gcc-3.2.3 test results.

Rewrite a block of suspicious code that had seemed to work properly in
the past, but failed with gcc-3.4.2 and mpatrol.

2005-02-03 [1107]

  facets.cpp
Forestall a gcc warning about a slightly unusual line of code already
documented as standard conforming.

Import these unit-test files from the cvs/lmi/skeleton branch.

  objects.make
Add imported unit tests.

  workhorse.make
Test idempotence of template-instantiation files, which are akin to
headers. Add test targets for the antediluvian branch's cgi-bin and
command-line interfaces.

Now, with gcc-3.4.2 and stricter warning flags: all code compiles with
no diagnostics, except for an unused-parameter warning in one boost
file; all unit tests succeed except for one in a facility slated for
replacement and one that detects standard-library conformance; and
mpatrol with default $(MPATROL_OPTIONS) issues no diagnostic for any
unit test.

  main.cpp
Number of iterations adapts to make self test take about five seconds.
Add several getopt options, implementing only a stub for regression
testing for now.

  mpatrol-mingw-GNUmakefile
Add 'install' target.

Rename ledger classes and files. Merge production branch's ledger
classes into the antediluvian branch. Rename tiered-charge classes and
files. Remove some gratuitous differences between account-value class
branches. Merge, rewrite, and rename death-benefit classes. Extend
self test in 'main.cpp'. Improve antediluvian branch's run time: even
though the production branch's ledger classes are slower, caching
table values makes solves about forty percent faster.

  outlay.cpp
  solve.cpp
Use smart instead of raw pointers to hold resources in some classes,
without fixing the parallel problem in others yet. Rename certain
data members for consistency. Speed of the antediluvian command-line
test is about four percent slower; the degradation is demonstrably
attributable to removal of the hand-written assignment operator and
copy ctor in class BasicValues. The tradeoff is acceptable because
the removed code was not clearly correct, and the implicitly-defined
special member functions bring the system a step closer to exception
safety.

2005-02-16 [1059]

  ledger.cpp
  ledger.hpp
Use smart instead of raw pointers to hold resources in another class,
eliminating hand-written special member functions as above. This
change makes the antediluvian command-line test run twelve percent
faster.

2005-02-17 [1059]

  ledger.hpp
Improve documentation.

  mpatrol_patch_test.cpp
  objects.make
Demonstrate the purpose of a patch submitted to mpatrol, and verify
that it has been applied.

  cgicc-patch-gwc-20050217
Workaround to make cgicc-3.1.4 work with the free, gcc-based MinGW
toolchain on the msw platform. Oddly enough, this GNU package appears
to support that platform only with non-free tools, which lmi users
must not be required to use; the same seems to be true even of the
current release, which however seems even more difficult to compile
with the MinGW toolchain. This casual workaround is not of sufficient
quality to propose as a patch to the maintainer.

  xmlwrapp-patch-gwc-20050217
Fix some oversights and frank errors in xmlwrapp-0.2.0 . It would seem
pointless to submit this patch to the maintainer because several later
versions have been released. It will become obsolete once a later
version of xmlwrapp has been tested.

  msw_common.make
  msw_generic.make
  workhorse.make
Expect to find third-party libraries where the File Hierarchy Standard
would suggest, in /usr/local . On posix systems like GNU/Linux, this
should just work. For msw, it encourages users to adopt a rational
file hierarchy.

  workhorse.make
Add a separate build directory for gprof.

  spew_touchstone
  workhorse.make
Add a test of production-branch account values.

  workhorse.make
Strengthen warning $(CFLAGS) for unit tests.

  GNUmakefile
Prevent 'check_conformity' target from complaining that patches and
testing touchstones don't follow source-code conventions: they
shouldn't.

2005-02-18 [1059]

bytes elicited a spurious diagnostic, though they were read correctly.

Use uppercase 'C' in old copyright notices, as FSF recommends.

  GNUmakefile
Add a test for lowercase 'c' in copyright notices. Remove test for
the author's old email address (which has been changed in all sources
already) and add an optional, customizable facility to search for
strings that any particular contributor may wish to prevent from
appearing accidentally in files about to be committed to cvs.

  GNUmakefile
Make sure that files embodying the GPL are created as prerequisites.
Check pixmaps for carriage returns; the documented 'xpm' format
doesn't permit embedding copyright and license notices or RCS Ids, and
they typically include tabs, so those things are not checked for.

2005-03-29 [1415]

  account_value.hpp
  census_view.cpp
  ihs_acctval.cpp
Experience rating refinements. Numerator of next year's k factor is
next year's naively-projected COI charge (this year's terminal NAAR
times next year's COI rate) instead of this year's COI charges divided
by one plus this year's k factor. COI charges for experience rating
are yearly totals (without monthly interest), accumulated at an annual
interest rate, instead of a total reflecting monthly interest; while
less exquisitely precise, this is consistent with the way claims are
accumulated, and easier to reproduce from other available columns.
Solves are now explicitly prevented with experience rating: they're
inconsistent with the present parallel accumulation anyway.

  account_value.hpp
  census_view.cpp
  ihs_acctval.cpp
  ihs_avmly.cpp
Display additional information on temporary experience-rating output.

  ihs_acctval.cpp
Suppress side effects of the obsolete experience-rating method.

  xml_notebook.cpp
Add a few lines of code to XmlNotebook::ConditionallyEnableItems(),
as comments only. This represents the only known observable difference
in behavior between cvs HEAD and an offline 20050105T1130Z snapshot
that might have been a cvs branch but was never committed. It's
commented out because it depends on speculative changes elsewhere.

  dbnames.xpp

Improve the OnExceptionInMainLoop() handler, unmasking a wx defect.

2005-03-30 [1415]

  dbnames.xpp
Correct a database entity's description.

  main_wx.cpp
Revert yesterday's change, which now seems to work, possibly due to
some unknown change in wx-2.5.4 . More testing is needed.

  account_value.hpp
  census_view.cpp
  ihs_acctval.cpp
Apportion experience reserve among individuals: even though this is
not the way it's intended to work, it's a precondition of the present
ledger classes that a composite is the weighted sum of individuals.
Suppress the test scaffolding for now unless a particular string
appears in the 'Comments' field; eventually, it'll be removed.

Adjust COI rate for k factor only on current-mortality basis; round
the adjusted COI rate.

  ihs_acctval.cpp
Reimplement net-claims calculation.

  inputs.cpp
Set new default: survive to age 99. Because coverage beyond maturity
is not illustrated, at least for now, this is the most reasonable
default for a composite. It has no effect on individual illustrations.

files are needed, and all concrete implementations can share the same
name, because only one may ever be defined.

  ledger_invariant.cpp

  numeric_io_cast.hpp
Correct misleading documentation. The orders-of-magnitude speed
difference formerly cited was measured with mpatrol in use, which
exaggerates the cost of memory allocation.

  [no unit test]            tested 'value_cast.hpp'
  'value_cast_test.cpp'     tested 'value_cast_ihs.hpp'
Now, more rationally,
  'value_cast_test.cpp'     tests  'value_cast.hpp'
  'value_cast_test_ihs.cpp' tests  'value_cast_ihs.hpp'
New file 'value_cast_test_ihs.cpp' is old file 'value_cast_test.cpp',

  ihs_crc_comp.cpp
Catch exceptions in main(), which had abended due to a long-double IO

exceptions prevents the abend; the next change (below) prevents the
observed exception from being thrown.

  GNUmakefile
Incorporate source directory's name in build directory's, in order to
prevent source in distinct sibling directories from incorrectly using
the same build directory.

  objects.make
  workhorse.make
Refactor, making both the lmi and the antediluvian branch use exactly
the same objects for their command-line and cgi-bin drivers. This
demonstrates substitutability of the two branches' calculation
libaries, making it an invariant that's enforced physically and
validated whenever the 'test' target is run.

  workhorse.make
Numerous improvements. The 'install' target runs much faster when
any files to be installed are already up to date. Regression testing
analysis reports certain differences that were previously ignored.
The 'prefix' and 'exec_prefix' variables expected by the GNU coding
standards are now respected. Shared libraries are used by default.

Change default inputs from

Users wouldn't be able to turn off a default solve through a GUI
interface that doesn't permit solves, and there was already too much
special-case code to override the former default solve in other cases
where it was inappropriate. It would make no sense to make the default
zero premium: the illustration would lapse instantly, producing a
report that would astonish new users, though a 20000 premium and a
1000000 specified amount are regrettably arbitrary defaults.

Clarify labels for extra loads and charges. These input fields had
been labeled as compensation, which is potentially confusing because
the system doesn't generally calculate compensation. The asset-based
charge applies only to separate-account assets, and it was potentially
confusing not to specify that. Other input skins left unchanged for
now because their users might already understand these issues and
might prefer to think of these fields as associated with compensation.

Revise treatment of third-party libraries. For libraries with exotic
build procedures (one of which even uses non-free tools), the lmi
makefiles create required objects in the normal way, as always. If
prebuilt libraries are available, as in some GNU/Linux distributions,
defining 'HAVE_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES' skips local compilation. The
latest version of xmlwrapp (not yet tested with lmi) is supported if
'-DUSING_CURRENT_LIBXMLWRAPP' is passed in 'CPPFLAGS' (xmlwrapp has no
way to report its version unless its weird build system is used). The
libxml2 dll import library for msw is now referred to by the name most

  GNUmakefile
Make quoting style consistent. Double quotes might seem preferable for
passing variables requiring expansion to submakefiles, e.g.,
  $(MAKE) -f some-submakefile OPTIONS="$(OPTIONS)" some-target
because that is the usual shell convention; but here gnu make is
passing a makefile variable, for which expansion occurs even within
single quotes. The reason for preferring single quotes is that double
quotes fail horribly in some cases on the msw platform, apparently
because make adds double quotes around the strings that represent
variable definitions when it passes them to submakefiles.

Expunge deprecated input fields representing assumed assets and number
of lives at the case level. They weren't available in any contemporary
input skin. They weren't ever a good idea anyway: accurate values need
the exact assets and number of lives, and the approximations these
fields enabled weren't disclaimed on reports. The original intention
was to make it easy to run a single cell in a case whose cells are
interdependent, e.g., because total case assets determine the level of
the M&E charge. However, exact values should be available, and users
can easily get a similar approximation by running a one-cell census
and manipulating the number of identical lives.

Change default inputs from

partially reverting the 2005-06-22 change. Reason: input skin
'xml_notebook_private_placement.xrc' has no input field for er
premium, so its users wouldn't be able to change it from 20000 to
zero; somewhat arbitrarily, this rationale regards ee premium as
more 'basic' than er premium, so it's not wholly satisfying.
In 'xml_notebook_single_premium.xrc', map the (one and only)
payment field to ee payment, with the regrettable effect that the
single premium shows up as ee premium on a supplemental report.
This dislikable workaround should be revisited later.

Correct two errors committed 20051212T1757Z. With these changes, a
static build, i.e.,
  /opt/lmi/bin[0]$./lmi_wx_static --data_path=/opt/lmi/data
works--all the tests hidden on its "Text" menu run correctly--but an
msw dll build abends on tests that throw an exception, because most
exceptions (in the tests, and in practice) cross a dll boundary.

20051213T0443Z <chicares@cox.net> [1212]

  xml_notebook.xrc
Fix some obvious shortcomings. Fields denoting months are deliberately
not constrained to [0, 11], however, even though that could be done
here. Reason: limiting the range for numeric fields generically is an
unimplemented feature that must be implemented in the program rather
than in the xml, and making it appear that this feature has already
been implemented for a few fields is at best a waste of effort and at
worst deceptive. We should erect no Potemkin villages.

  ihs_irc7702a.cpp

Optionally build with elf visibility attributes. This is claimed to
have major benefits for posix:
  http://www.nedprod.com/programs/gccvisibility.html
and costs nothing extra to set up because of its similarity to msw
__declspec attributes; but it has not yet been tested on an elf
system, and may need adjustment because the elf and msw attributes
are not syntactically identical.

  configurable_settings.cpp

  inputs.cpp
Add default-input filepath to xml configuration. Remove the former
default-product entity, which this supersedes. This change makes it
imperative to update 'configurable_settings.xml', obligatorily
removing 'default_product', e.g.,
-  <default_product>sample</default_product>
and optionally adding 'default_input_filename', e.g.
+  <default_input_filename>/foo/default.ill</default_input_filename>
with a value that specifies a 'complete' 'file path' with extension
'.ill', according to the definitions here:
  http://boost.org/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm#Definitions
For GNU/Linux systems, '/etc/opt/lmi/default.ill' is suggested. For
msw, one might use 'x:/d/default.ill' where 'x:' is the drive letter
and '/d/' is some 'directory path'; omitting the drive letter can
cause the "kinky" problem described here:

  inputillus_xml_io.cpp
  xml_notebook.xrc
Partially implement 'EffectiveDateToday'. If that checkbox is checked:
disable 'EffectiveDate'; and set 'EffectiveDate' to the current date,
only when an input file is read. Reading the default-input file counts
as reading an input file. 'EffectiveDate' does not, however, change
when the user checks 'EffectiveDateToday': the planned facility to
force such changes has not yet been implemented. Without this change,
new files created from default input would always bear the default
file's 'EffectiveDate', which would discomfit end users.

Resolve the issues noted 20060712T0511Z. This file is now identical to
the latest revision in the skeleton trunk except for the additional
speed measurements. All tests are passed with gcc, como, and borland.
The overall speed difference is immaterial, as shown by these timings
for gcc, presented in the same format as the test's output:

                     new        old     ratio
  Aggregate    :  4.66E-006  4.69E-006   0.99

Fix monthly-report withdrawals; experimentally address a 7702A defect.
Formerly, the last nonzero withdrawal propagated forward into all
future years; now it is set to zero when no withdrawal is taken. This
was evident in the monthly-detail report, but the incorrect value was
disregarded for other reports and for monthiversary processing. It did
however affect 7702A calculations in a way that was the opposite of
conservative.

Import selected changes from skeleton trunk. A notable difference in
behavior is that changes in date and spin controls are recognized only
upon loss of focus. Previously, e.g., typing '1960' into 'DateOfBirth'
a keystroke at a time forced immediate but erratic 'IssueAge' changes:
age became '5' after the first keystroke (because the msw date control
considers '1' to represent 2001), and didn't assume the desired value
of '46' until the last keystroke was typed. Now, the age changes only
after the date control loses focus.

  inputillus.cpp
Synchronize DateOfBirth and IssueAge. Two distinct but interrelated
classes represented input data in the legacy system that lmi replaced.
Changes to one must be reflected in the other, but, defectively, dates
and ages were not always kept consistent. This change complements the
change made 20060623T1814Z, for the opposite order of reflection. Both
classes were copied into lmi for compatibility with other copied code.
Both should be removed: lmi's own MVC Model class handles reflection
of dates and ages, as well as other data relationships, more naturally
and reliably.

Add more macros to address differing library philosophies: xmlwrapp
permits creating whole branches of new elements and grafting them onto

from an existing trunk, and neither seems to accommodate the other's
method. Soon a single xml library will be chosen and support for the
other removed along with these macros.

  input.hpp
  input_harmonization.cpp
Improve member names.

20061201T1204Z <chicares@cox.net> [1225]

  input_harmonization.cpp
Make sure database is initialized. The extra test now added appeared
unnecessary according to the specious reasoning of a comment now
removed; the flaw in that reasoning is that class instances can be
created other than by the default ctor.

20061201T1205Z <chicares@cox.net> [1227]

  census_view.cpp
Test birthdate consistency when a census is pasted.

20061201T1350Z <chicares@cox.net> [1227]

  calendar_date.hpp
  facets.hpp
Add visibility attributes to certain free functions, fixing some
problems with 'build_type=so_test'.

20061202T2251Z <chicares@cox.net> [1227]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, local objects are preferably created on the stack.

20061203T0736Z <chicares@cox.net> [1227]

  preferences_view.xrc
  xml_notebook.xrc
  xml_notebook_coli_boli.xrc
  xml_notebook_private_placement.xrc
  xml_notebook_single_premium.xrc
Remove obsolete and erroneous elements. The <usenotebooksizer> element
obsolete. Hardcoded <size> elements for
  <object class="wxNotebook" name=[whatever]>
were always defective, and wx-2.8 no longer ignores them as earlier
versions did.

20061203T1807Z <chicares@cox.net> [1228]

  inputillus_sequences.cpp
Demonstrate boost::minmax_element, which should be used generally.
A deliberate side effect of this change is that the system no longer
compiles with boost-1.31 .

20061203T2233Z <chicares@cox.net> [1228]

  docmanager_ex.cpp
  docmanager_ex.hpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, boost::scoped_ptr is used to share instances of wx objects,
created with new(wx), across member functions of an lmi class.

20061203T2234Z <chicares@cox.net> [1228]

  ihs_irc7702.hpp
Prevent "grand theft pointer"
  http://www.gotw.ca/gotw/062.htm
by making a class with a std::auto_ptr member noncopyable. Classes
that don't need to be copied should generally be noncopyable. This
case provides sufficient motivation for reevaluating all use of
std::auto_ptr.

20061203T2302Z <chicares@cox.net> [1230]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
  ihs_irc7702.hpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, boost::scoped_ptr is used instead of std::auto_ptr; it would
probably be better to use no smart pointer at all, but this class has
no unit test and needs a thorough rewrite anyway.

20061204T0619Z <chicares@cox.net> [1231]

  secure_date.cpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, boost::scoped_ptr isn't a much better choice than std::auto_ptr;
this class really needs to be rewritten, and no smart pointer should
be used at all.

20061204T0635Z <chicares@cox.net> [1232]

  ihs_commfns.cpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, boost::scoped_ptr is now used instead of std::auto_ptr. It would
probably be better to use no smart pointer at all, but the code
modified is an ancient unit test that's defectively not called, and
needs deeper reconsideration--including an investigation of the
memory-leak issues noted inline, which might have been mere artifacts
of a poor pre-standard auto_ptr implementation.

20061204T0649Z <chicares@cox.net> [1233]

  ihs_server7702.cpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, boost::scoped_ptr is now used instead of std::auto_ptr; it would
probably be better to use no smart pointer at all, but this class has
no unit test and needs a thorough rewrite anyway.

20061204T0650Z <chicares@cox.net> [1233]

  ihs_standalone.cpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, it seemed safe to eliminate the smart pointers altogether
because of parallel changes in other classes that are well tested.

20061204T0656Z <chicares@cox.net> [1234]

  calculate.hpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, boost::scoped_ptr is now used instead of std::auto_ptr; it would
probably be better to use no smart pointer at all, but this class has
no unit test and needs a thorough rewrite anyway.

20061204T0715Z <chicares@cox.net> [1234]

  inputillus.cpp
Remove an unneeded header.

20061204T0716Z <chicares@cox.net> [1233]

  inputs.cpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, boost::scoped_ptr is now used instead of std::auto_ptr; it would
probably be better to use a single smart-pointer member instead of
multiple local smart pointers, but this class is slated for retirement
and doesn't deserve such profound revision.

20061204T0816Z <chicares@cox.net> [1232]

  input.cpp
  input.hpp
  input_harmonization.cpp
Use std::auto_ptr only when ownership-transfer semantics are wanted.
Here, boost::scoped_ptr is now used to share an instance of the
database class across member functions.

Always initialize shared-pointer member.

20061206T0218Z <chicares@cox.net> [1231]

  commutation_functions_test.cpp
Rewrite, removing a requirement that class ULCommFns be copyable. It
may be argued whether the rewritten code is less obscure or merely
more verbose, but not whether the boost lambda documentation clearly
warns of this implicit requirement or explains how to overcome it.

20061206T0219Z <chicares@cox.net> [1231]

  ihs_commfns.hpp
Make class ULCommFns noncopyable.

  main_cli.cpp
Revise self test. The benchmark values were never correct in cvs, even
in revision 1.1: they corresponded to an older version of the 'sample'
product. Several input parameters now have values equal to defaults:
there's no good reason for them to differ, and a general-account rate
of twelve percent has long since been forbidden.

validation fails.

20061217T1902Z <chicares@cox.net> [1239]

  passkey_test.cpp
Reset the cache before each test that does not assume caching. This
generalization of the 20061216T1755Z change makes the test suite more
robust: it is easier to maintain each test's preconditions locally
than to ensure local preconditions by managing the global state.

20061217T1932Z <chicares@cox.net> [1239]

  passkey_test.cpp
Revise values that disagreed with documentation. It is better to

  https://sv.nongnu.org/bugs/?13856

20070125T1346Z <chicares@cox.net> [1245]

  timer.hpp
Revise aliquot-timer output. Only unit time is important, so show it
two ways to facilitate comparisons. Total time is not important, so
stop showing it, noting that this makes the power-of-ten quantization
of iteration count unnecessary.

20070125T1507Z <chicares@cox.net> [1245]

  timer.hpp
Rewrite aliquot timer's operator()(). Repeat the timed operation until
the allotted time runs out--but never more than one hundred times,
because further repetitions are wasteful and don't improve accuracy.

Replace product-editor icons. The originals were silently ignored by
wx (perhaps because they were too large?). These four icons are lame,
and identical; eventually, all product files should be merged into a
single file type anyway, and a better icon devised.

Include any local header for a public base class first, followed by a
blank line. This guideline has been followed almost uniformly in the
past, but hasn't (yet) been added to the lmi coding standard. It is a
logical corollary of the rule cited above on 20070311T1340Z, and it

Include the right header for a base class. Here, "view_ex.hpp" was
clearly not needed because class ViewEx is not used, but removing it
prevented compilation because "view_ex.hpp" includes <wx/docview.h>,
which apparently must bring in the declaration of class wxPanel
(though it conceivably might not in a future wx version).

Improve cygwin support. Now the production system builds, though cgicc
targets do not. With '-mno-cygwin', the libxml2 and wx libraries used
in production for msw suffice as long as their dlls are found--e.g.,
if they are placed on $PATH, which also addresses the unit-testing
limitation noted 20070407T1420Z.

  authenticity.cpp
Mitigate the defect noted 20070704T0439Z. Dates 'begin' and 'end' were
value-initialized to today's date, and intended to be overwritten with
values extracted from a file--without adequate provision against file
corruption. Before the 20070703 changes, a failing extractor overwrote
them with undefined values. Before the present change, a failing
extractor left their initial values alone, resulting in a misleading
error message at best, or at worst an invalid authentication of an
inauthentic system (iff a distribution omitted an md5sum for the
'expiry' file). With the present change, the worse case is prevented,
and an error message is displayed in both cases tested. The behavior
remains defective: the error message names a date on which no one
would conceivably use the system; if there's an error reading the
'expiry' file, then the message should say so plainly.

Specify $(EXEEXT) more uniformly.

20070731T0043Z <chicares@cox.net> [1223]

  alert_wx.cpp
Indent comments for #include directives uniformly, starting them in
the fiftieth column if that doesn't make the line longer than eighty
characters, to increase readability and maintainability. Generally, if
searching forward for the basename of a header finds any name that
obviously requires including it, then that header's #include directive
needs no comment.

20070731T0104Z <chicares@cox.net> [1223]

  alert_wx.cpp
Separate msw from posix implementation of safe_message_alert(). In
this case the posix implementation of wxSafeShowMessage() offers no
advantage over standard-library functions.

  alert_wx.cpp
Improve safe_message_alert(). Formerly, these steps
  alt-T A E
  [click anywhere on application except the messagebox]

real-world problems that could affect users.

  GNUmakefile
  test_coding_rules.cpp
Move the test added 20070706T2107Z from a script into C++: output can
easily be one line shorter, and compiled code runs quite a bit faster.

20070803T2211Z <chicares@cox.net> [1219]

  install_mingw.make [new file]
  mingw_setup.make   [expunged]
Replace a poorer makefile with a better. The new file is an exact copy
of 'mingw_install.make' in the 'gwc/' subdirectory; its new name will
make grouping clearer if we add other 'install_*.make' files.

20070803T2333Z <chicares@cox.net> [1219]

  [ChangeLog only]
Require defects to be marked distinctively. We have been committing
far too many defects to HEAD.

  install_mingw.make
Fix defect introduced 20061206T1724Z (in the 'gwc/' subdirectory).
It does no good to install source where binaries are needed; the
resulting installation has no standard headers.

20070804T1523Z <chicares@cox.net> [1219]

  install_mingw.make
Abstract the system-root notion instead of hard-coding an MSYS value.

Abstract options for 'wget', changing one and documenting why.

Deduce makefile name instead of hard-coding it.

20070804T2013Z <chicares@cox.net> [1219]

Improve documentation, capturing a tidbit from 'setup.make'.

20070804T2104Z <chicares@cox.net> [1217]

  setup.make
Remove MinGW section: 'install_mingw.make' is preferable. It is
presumed that the removed section stood alone, and in particular that
its '%.tar.bz2' and '%.tar.gz' rules were used nowhere else.

  input_test.cpp
Improve documentation.

20071002T1332Z <chicares@cox.net> [1217]

create a log file unconditionally even if nothing is written to it.

20071002T1334Z <chicares@cox.net> [1217]

20071007T2301Z <chicares@cox.net> [1215]

  actuarial_table.cpp
Remove a defect marker now regarded as invalid. The extra diagnostic
information that had been contemplated is not valuable enough to
justify violating the separation of concerns between modules.

20071007T2345Z <chicares@cox.net> [1215]

  actuarial_table.cpp
Assert more preconditions.

20071008T0027Z <chicares@cox.net> [1215]

20071106T0300Z <chicares@cox.net> [1207]

  setup.make
Remove sections for tools provided by cygwin.

20071106T0351Z <chicares@cox.net> [1207]

  workhorse.make
Suppress a harmless gcc-4.2.1 warning.

20071111T1633Z <chicares@cox.net> [1207]

  libxslt-1.1.17-lmi.patch [new file]
Patch a third-party library.

20071112T1538Z <chicares@cox.net> [1207]

  install_libxml2_libxslt.make [new file]
Import from 'gwc/' subdirectory.

20071112T2013Z <wboutin@massmutual.com> [1207]

  xml_notebook_group_carveout.xrc [new file]
Add new input skin.

20071112T2023Z <wboutin@massmutual.com> [1207]

  xml_notebook_group_carveout.xrc
Improve documentation.

20071114T0313Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  multidimgrid_any.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20070401T1429Z. It now appears that two casts
needed to be changed, but only one was actually changed then.

20071114T0315Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  main_wx.cpp
Don't require wxUSE_STL (VZ).

20071118T1600Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  workhorse.make
Adapt to new msw build environment.

20071119T0020Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_wx.make [new file]
Import from 'gwc/' subdirectory.

20071123T1431Z <wboutin@massmutual.com> [1210]

  version.hpp
Mark release candidate.

20071127T1535Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  GNUmakefile
Remove a $PATH dependency.

20071128T1619Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_mingw.make
Adopt a more general idiom already used elsewhere.

20071128T1620Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_miscellanea.make
For concinnity, rename an aggressive 'clean' target to 'clobber'.

20071128T1623Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_libxml2_libxslt.make
Improve concinnity.

20071128T1632Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_libxml2_libxslt.make
Configure for 'i686-pc-mingw32'.

20071129T1547Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_libxml2_libxslt.make
  install_miscellanea.make
  install_wx.make
Remove repeated tests for 'wget' availability. The test is left in
place in 'install_mingw.make' because that file is intended to be
usable in other environments than Cygwin.

20071129T2321Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_wx.make
Avoid redirecting normal output inside makefile.

20071129T2326Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_miscellanea.make
Remove a disused artifact.

20071202T0013Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_mingw.make
Optionally use a named cache directory.

20071202T0014Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_miscellanea.make
  install_wx.make
Change cache directory. Moving it outside the '/opt/lmi' hierarchy
makes it possible to reinstall from scratch by removing the entire
'/opt/lmi' tree without losing archives that are costly to download,
and makes reinstallation more robust because downloads can fail.

20071202T0059Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_miscellanea.make
Install sample databases.

20071203T1107Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_libxml2_libxslt.make
Download archives to cache directory.

20071203T1108Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  install_miscellanea.make
Fix defect introduced 20071202T0059Z. Idempotence had been broken by
a 'mkdir' command that should have been permitted to fail because the
'clobber' target doesn't undo its effect.

20071203T1111Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1212]

  install_msw.sh [new file]
Import from 'gwc/' subdirectory.

20071203T1605Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1211]

  install_msw.sh
Resolve a marked defect.

20071206T0423Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1211]

  install_miscellanea.make
Improve documentation.

20071206T0428Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1211]

  install_msw.sh
Capture md5sums of archives, before and after any new download.

20071206T0437Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1211]

  install_msw.sh
Test for unwanted dependency on Cygwin dll.

20071206T0528Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  setup.make
No longer create dummy libraries. The custom-configured wx build
required for lmi already disables all dependencies on libraries with
deviant licenses.

20071206T0536Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1210]

  setup.make
No longer build a vintage 'libxml2'.

20071206T0547Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  setup.make [expunged]
Remove an obsolete file.

20071208T0313Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  install_libxml2_libxslt.make
  install_msw.sh
  install_wx.make
Mount MinGW gcc; use it wherever Cygwin gcc had been used. Previously,
Cygwin gcc had been used for lmi itself (but not for libraries) in
order to mimic an anomaly in our current production environment, which
is benign today, but fragile.

20071209T2208Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  install_msw.sh
Create authentication files.

20071209T2210Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  install_mingw.make
Update mailing-list links.

20071211T0204Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  install_miscellanea.make
Build a regex library.

20071211T1349Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  miscellany.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z: poor indentation.

20071211T1439Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  miscellany.cpp
Rename local variables: cf. today() in 'calendar_date.cpp'. Making
these functions as similar as possible emphasizes differences and
reveals defects.

20071211T1504Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  calendar_date.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z: missing 'std::'.

20071211T1529Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  calendar_date.cpp
  miscellany.cpp
Regularize constness; guard against failure in C RTL.

20071211T1626Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  miscellany.cpp
Simplify.

20071214T1503Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  objects.make
  test_coding_rules.cpp
Test copyright. This change introduces a dependency on boost::regex.
Measurement shows that this test runs two decimal orders of magnitude
faster than the slightly less powerful shell loop in 'GNUmakefile'.
This is important because the sluggishness of 'make check_concinnity'
impedes productivity.

20071215T0322Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules.cpp
Return EXIT_FAILURE on exception.

20071215T1227Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20060118T1216Z: an error processing one file
shouldn't prevent processing of other files.

20071215T1358Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules.cpp
Open predefined standard streams in binary mode.

20071215T1756Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules_test.sh [new file]
  workhorse.make
Add an automated test.

20071215T1857Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules_test.sh
Add a test for '.'.

20071215T1925Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules.cpp
  test_coding_rules_test.sh
Eschew return codes; prefer exceptions; don't mix the twain.

20071216T0104Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules.cpp
Refactor.

20071216T0124Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules_test.sh
Add a test designed to succeed.

20071216T0125Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

Remove a test now performed by 'test_coding_rules.cpp'.

20071216T1332Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules.cpp
Refactor.

20071216T1437Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

Refactor.

20071217T1321Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

Improve documentation.

20071218T0332Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

Refactor.

20071218T1511Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  GNUmakefile
Include 'config.hpp' in 'version.hpp' as in other headers.

20071218T1512Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  md5.hpp
Reformat to match /^#include "config.hpp"$/ as other headers do,
to make a style guideline simpler to enforce.

20071218T1641Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules.cpp
Refactor. Distinguishing full_name() from leaf_name() makes it harder
to misuse either accidentally. Such misuse could resurrect the issue
addressed 20071218T0219Z.

20071219T1521Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  regex_test.cpp
Augment documentation.

20071219T1522Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

Augment tests, revealing an issue.

20071220T1231Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  test_coding_rules.cpp
  test_coding_rules_test.sh
Address issue identified 20071219T1526Z as explained 20071219T1521Z.

20071220T1615Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  rtti_lmi.hpp
Update mailing-list link.

20071220T1856Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1208]

  GNUmakefile
  test_coding_rules.cpp
  test_coding_rules_test.sh
Strengthen and relocate some style rules.

20071221T0625Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  input.cpp
  input_harmonization.cpp
  inputillus_xml_io.cpp
Enable 'CorporationPremiumTableFactor', as 'InsuredPremiumTableFactor'
has already been enabled. This is an experimental change; subject to
testing, it may need to be reverted.

20071222T0210Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  expm1.c
  md5.cpp
  md5.hpp
  xrange.hpp
Regularize comment style somewhat, with the immediate goal of making
it easier to find labels with a simple regex.

20071222T0520Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  ihs_irc7702a.cpp
Regularize comment style somewhat, with the immediate goal of making

  test_coding_rules.cpp
  test_coding_rules_test.sh
Enforce various taboos.

  my_test_coding_rules.cpp [new file]
  objects.make
  test_coding_rules.cpp

Provide for unutterable taboos.

20071227T2118Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

Regularize defect markers.

20071228T1517Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  authenticity_test.cpp
  input_test.cpp
  name_value_pairs_test.cpp
Avoid "!!" except in defect markers, to make them easier to parse. The
idiom is not invalid C, but OTOH these changes strengthen the tests,
because 'good()' is a stronger condition than '!fail()'.

20071229T1414Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  md5.hpp
Regularize a "!!" marker.

20071229T1416Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  GNUmakefile
  test_coding_rules.cpp
  test_coding_rules_test.sh
Strengthen and relocate defect-marker checking.

20071229T1546Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  GNUmakefile
Omit 'forbidden.make', merging leftover tests from an old copy. The
rest of the tests that it originally contained had already been moved
to a private 'my_test_coding_rules.cpp'.

20071229T1547Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  test_coding_rules.cpp
Improve documentation.

20071231T1222Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  test_coding_rules_test.sh
Relocate test for malformed RCS Id.

20071231T1652Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  GNUmakefile
  test_coding_rules.cpp

20080118T1417Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  install_miscellanea.make
Fix defect introduced 20071211T0204Z. The '/opt/lmi/local/lib'
subdirectory might not yet exist, and hardcoding '/opt/lmi' instead of
using $(prefix) is erroneous if $(prefix) is overridden.

20080118T1923Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  ihs_acctval.cpp
Treat claims and COI charges consistently for experience rating.
Formerly, net COI charges were recognized for every month, while
claims occur only at year end; an anomaly arose upon lapse. Now, if
claims are zero due to lapse, then so are the net COI charges used in
experience rating. It would be more exact to count both for a partial
year, but partial mortality is predicated upon "curtate" deaths that
occur at year end only; and no such exquisite refinement is required
because the experience-rating process is self correcting.

20080118T1948Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

Reformat.

20080118T2057Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

20080120T1415Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1207]

  ihs_avmly.cpp
Remove an anomaly by rounding differently. Formerly, 'NetCoiCharge'
was calculated as the difference between two quantities, only one of
which was rounded before subtraction; small negative values were
occasionally observed, whereas this charge should be nonnegative. Now,
it is calculated as the difference between two rounded quantities.

element.

  como_4_3_3.make
Detect a path clash. It hasn't been an actual problem yet because an
antique toolset had a custom-built 'make' (and little else) in
'/usr/bin/', but it does pose a problem with Cygwin.

20080405T2325Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1177]

Require validated versions of gnu tools used for special purposes.
Later versions may work just as well, but there were significant
preprocessor changes between gcc-2.95 and gcc-3, so it's best to

Suppress html help until it's been signed off by testers. The heart of
the 20080302T0307Z change is suppressed with a conditional that's easy
to override for testing (CPPFLAGS=-DDO_NOT_SUPPRESS_HELP), though the
html help contents can simply be reviewed in a web browser.

Add new output columns, splitting CSV by account. It would have been
ideal to calculate these as "derived" columns like "NetDeathBenefit",
and to split AV in the Ledger object, except that the schizophrenia
inherent in 'ledger_xml_io*.cpp' must be resolved first.

  actuarial_table_test.cpp
Refactor to increase clarity and flexibility.

20080522T1353Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1169]

  actuarial_table_test.cpp
Replace a partial with a complete table. Using only the end of a table
is expedient when potential defects are expected at the end, but using
a complete table makes it easier to look for defects where unexpected.
The original table is slightly degenerate in that its maximum age
equals its maximum select age plus its select period; any degeneracy
in a test table potentially permits defective code to pass.

20080523T0153Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1169]

  actuarial_table_test.cpp
Use a table that's likelier to fail unit tests. The 20080522T1353Z
rationale applies here as well. Furthermore, the table now replaced
was dangerously degenerate. For instance, it had several runs of
identical values in succession--most notably, its last six values were
all zero. Worst of all, its minimum age was zero, which is why the
defect fixed 20080518T1559Z was not detected earlier; experimentally
reverting that correction now produces fourteen unit-test failures.

Add a free function to measure duration between two dates.

20080528T1410Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1169]

  ihs_basicval.cpp
For durations, prefer integral_duration() to attained_age(): the
former has one fewer argument that might be incorrect, while the
latter permits only one ordering of date arguments and otherwise gives
a runtime diagnostic that's appropriate only for age calculations.

20080528T1415Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1169]

  calendar_date.hpp
Document integral_duration()'s especially strong noncommutativity.
Ordinary subtraction is commutative except for sign, but for this
function |f(a,b)| may not equal |f(b,a)|.

20080528T1418Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1169]

  ihs_basicval.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20071019T0250Z. Commutativity was incorrectly

  actuarial_table.hpp
Fix defect introduced 20080530T0120Z. In a comment, the wrong term was
negated when stating a precondition. Measuring durations in opposite
directions creates confusion; this should be refactored soon.

Fix defect introduced 20071006T2256Z. Inforce had not been considered
appropriately. This change is committed before writing unit tests in
order to get it into the hands of testers with celerity.

20080531T0255Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [1169]

  actuarial_table_test.cpp
Test a precondition that hadn't been tested. The unit test removed
20080531T0304Z had the palpable intention of covering this case, but
the sign of the reset-duration argument didn't achieve that; see the
last sentence of the 20080530T1656Z commit message.

Offer additional supplemental-report columns. Semantics of the last
one soon will change. There are two distinct types of separate-account
charges: a classical "M&E" that affects unit values; and a less-common
"load" that does not, but is rather a deduction from account value.
Right now, LedgerVariant::SepAcctLoad is only the latter. Soon it'll
be renamed and redefined to mean the sum of both types of charges.

  ihs_avmly.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050507T0336Z, while fixing a related complex
of defects that predate the lmi epoch. Formerly, these data members
  AccountValue::YearsTotalGrossIntCredited
  LedgerVariant::GrossIntCredited
were zeroed whenever the separate-account interest rate is zero. Now,
they equal the corresponding "Net" variables in that case. This change
is deliberately minimal rather than tasteful. Its effect on regression
tests is widespread, and what is minimal is straightforward to accept.
A subsequent refactoring will be less obviously safe, but simple to
validate by exhaustive comparison of numerical test results.

Rename ledger column "SepAcctLoad" to "SepAcctCharges". For now, it
still contains the "load" only, rather than "load" + "M&E". This step
is taken separately because it affects all system-testing '.test'
files in a way that this command:
  sed -e's/^SepAcctLoad$/SepAcctCharges/'
predicts exactly.

  inputillus.cpp
Rewrite handling of default input file. Formerly, if a default file
existed, it was used to initialize almost every object of the obsolete
input class--except when prevented by a magical bool ctor argument.
The purpose of the magical argument is documented as preventing
recursion in the ctor, yet it's used in other cases where the default
file should not be read. Now, the default file is read only when a new
document is created, its contents are used only in that circumstance,
and the magical argument is ignored--it will be removed, and not
ported to the modern input class.

  ledger_text_formats.cpp
Remove dubious claim-adjusted IRRs. The notion of IRR on "cash flow"
is valid, but the implementation was questionable; and using it only
in tab-delimited output created a gratuitous difference between this

such discrepancy because it runs a single isolated cell.

  path_utility_test.cpp
Add a function to make a filename portable. This is required for
  https://savannah.nongnu.org/support/?105907
because 'CensusFilename.Firstname Lastname.000000001.pdf' is not
portable, so write_ledger_as_pdf() would turn it into 'output.pdf';
yet people's names, unlike portable filenames, do contain spaces.

20081205T1059Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [901]

  ihs_mortal.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch. The product of current COI rate and its multiplier had
been limited only by an overall maximum (e.g. 0.08333333) when the
current COI rate table is monthly. Instead, it is now limited to the
product of guaranteed COI and guaranteed-COI multiplier, as has always
been correctly done if the current COI rate table is annual.

20081205T1301Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [901]

  ihs_mortal.cpp
Refactor. Old code, temporarily left in place though now dead, is
equivalent, though not quite identical. For example, in the annual,
experience-rated case, guaranteed COI was limited to unity, then
converted to monthly and limited to a monthly maximum that makes the
earlier limitation to unity superfluous; current COI, on the other
hand, was converted to monthly, limited to a monthly maximum, and then
limited again to the same maximum. Now, the same code is used for both
current and guaranteed, making it easier to test and refactor. See:

  ihs_basicval.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch. Corridor strategies for specamt and premium used CVAT
corridor factors always, instead of the actual definitional test.

20090118T1124Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [878]

reminiscent of the 20080516T1359Z change, but the cause differed.

20090119T1224Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [877]

  ihs_basicval.cpp
Refine death-benefit discount for pay-deductions strategy. The rounded
discount rate typically spelled out in the contract ("NAARDiscount" in
the product database) should be used instead of an unrounded rate. The
parallel code in GetModalSpecAmtMlyDed() needs no such change because
it is slated for expunction as noted 20090118T1124Z.

  ihs_acctval.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20080623T1318Z (and remarked then). For products
that set the 'LapseIgnoresSurrChg' flag (which prevents lapse merely
due to a surrender charge as long as account value is nonnegative),
some solves were unsuccessful. Because of the precaution described in
footnote [4] here:
  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/lmi/2009-02/msg00000.html
an unsuccessful solve does not lead to an incorrect illustration. See:

  input_harmonization.cpp
Remove an illogical restriction. Loan solves were forbidden, due to
some once-suspected but unspecified defect, when withdrawal-then-loan
solves and explicitly-entered loans are permitted.

20090223T1313Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [812]

  input_seq_test.cpp
Demonstrate default behavior: an all-blank string is treated as zero.

20090223T1555Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [812]

  input_harmonization.cpp
  input_realization.cpp
Enable COI multiplier for all users, guarding against all-blank input
(erasing the input mustn't silently set the multiplier to a default of
zero). Only home-office users can enter a value less than a minimum
that for now is hardcoded as ninety percent. Anyone can enter an
arbitrarily large multiplier.

20090301T2125Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [812]

  skin.xrc
Remove a control that was (harmfully) duplicated on another tab.

20090301T2126Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [812]

  ihs_avsolve.cpp
Assert consistency of WD vs. WD-then-loan inputs: specifically, these
relationships between 'SolveType' and 'WithdrawToBasisThenLoan':
   mce_solve_wd           --> !WithdrawToBasisThenLoan
   mce_solve_wd_then_loan -->  WithdrawToBasisThenLoan
must hold, or the program is probably incorrect. These assertions show
that the {WD, WD-then-loan} distinction in 'SolveType' is superfluous.

20091006T0258Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [764]

  ihs_commfns.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch. This addresses the problem with annuity values noted
20091006T0257Z.

20091006T0302Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [764]

  ihs_commfns.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch. This addresses the problem with net single premiums
noted 20091006T0257Z, for many but not all durations.

20091006T0309Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [763]

  ihs_commfns.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch, and (vaguely) marked as defective ab origine. Consider:
//      LMI_ASSERT(1.0 != f);
        f = std::min(0.99999999, f);
        double g = 1.0 / (1.0 + f);
Neither the assertion nor the kludge following it actually avoids
division by zero, which would occur if 'f' were equal to negative one,
not positive one. It is not necessary to avoid dividing one by two;
and dividing one by 1.99999999 instead decreases accuracy. This would
presumably have no material affect on today's production system, which
uses only monthly-mode UL commutation functions, so that 'f' (Eckley's
Q'') wouldn't normally approach unity. This fixes the last of the
problems noted 20091006T0257Z. These fixes also improve the speed at
which commutation functions are generated by about forty percent.

20091006T1138Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [763]

Refactor.

20091006T1303Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [763]

Move 'e_island' out of the unit-test TU. Instantiating such types in
the TU that uses them is valid, but is deliberately avoided everywhere
else and need not be demonstrated by unit tests.

Consolidate and expand documentation. For virtual functions, meaty
documentation in the base class and nothing in derived classes is
better than nothing in the base class and a one-liner cut and pasted
in derived classes, especially since doxygen links derived-class
implementations to the base-class documentation for each documented
virtual. It does no harm to provide an empty implementation of a pure
virtual merely as a hook upon which to hang documentation.

Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch. In practice, very few product-database entities vary by
duration, so handling those that do not in the simplest manner is an
important speed optimization; however, the simple code branch was
unreachable because its condition was incorrect.

20120104T2303Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [597]

  census_view.cpp
Use textctrls rather than spinctrls for doubles (VS). See:
  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/lmi/2011-12/msg00015.html

20120106T0751Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [597]

  gpt_specamt.cpp
  ihs_irc7702.cpp
  ihs_irc7702.hpp
Refactor to eliminate an ugly workaround.

20120107T1326Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [597]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch, as noted 20111119T2005Z and now discussed inline.

20120108T0230Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [597]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
Improve documentation, heralding changes to come.

20120108T0231Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [597]

  gpt_specamt.cpp
Remove an ugly reinitialization that no longer serves any purpose.

20120108T0911Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [595]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
  ihs_irc7702.hpp
Refactor for simplicity.

20120111T0817Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [595]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
  input.cpp
  input.hpp
  input_harmonization.cpp
  skin.xrc
  yare_input.hpp
Reorder inforce inputs: e.g., GLP naturally precedes cumulative GLP.

20120111T0918Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [595]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
  ihs_irc7702.hpp
Distinguish inforce year and inforce month for future use.

Prepare inforce tax fields for use.

20120111T1507Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [593]

  ihs_basicval.cpp
Pass inforce inputs to GPT class. This change causes initial GLP to
change from one wrong value to another (but not in the first inforce
year), yet does not affect the (also wrong) value of initial GSP.

20120111T1723Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [592]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch, and noted as such ab initio: absent an adjustment event
it is incorrect to calculate guidelines as of inforce duration.

20120111T1746Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [592]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating

even if it's still in the first year.

20120111T1926Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [588]

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch: initialize inforce data not to a constant zero, but
instead from input values.

20120113T1426Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [588]

  ihs_avdebug.cpp
Remove needless "Is material change" field. If there is a material
change, then the seven-pay premium almost certainly changes.

20120113T2236Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [588]

  ihs_avdebug.cpp
Rename and move the 7702A "amounts paid" field.

  ihs_irc7702.cpp
Fix defect introduced 20050114T1947Z, from an original file predating
the lmi epoch: don't override inforce input values.

20120115T1035Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [586]

  skin.xrc
No longer label GPT inforce fields as unimplemented.

20120115T1358Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [586]

20120118T1122Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [587]

  ihs_avmly.cpp
Mark a defect.

20120118T1340Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [587]

  ihs_avdebug.cpp
Suppress irrelevant monthly-trace data.

20120119T2209Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [586]

  ihs_basicval.cpp
  ihs_irc7702.cpp
  ihs_irc7702.hpp
Remove unwanted arguments from Irc7702::Irc7702().

20120121T1136Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [615]

  census_view_old.cpp
  census_view_old.hpp
Restore wxListView census manager from revision 5304 under a new name,
updating only copyright, header name, and include guards for now. The
goal is to release a stable system while wxDVC development continues,
but without changes like those made 20111026T1342Z and 20111028T1211Z.

20120121T1144Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [586]

  census_view_old.cpp
  census_view_old.hpp
Replace defect markers in obsolescent code restored 20120121T1136Z.

Update copyright notices.

20130103T2217Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [545]

  license.cpp
Write copyright notice on one line, so it'll be updated automatically.
This precludes oversights such as the one fixed 20110323T1518Z.

20130103T2243Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [545]

  GNUmakefile
Don't create new-year backup directory if it already exists. This
prevents overwriting the contents of last year's backup directory when
the 'happy_new_year' target's instructions are overlooked.

20130103T2311Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [545]

  GNUmakefile
Fix defect introduced 20120508T1347Z: missing quotes in shell command.
Code added to work around an empty argument was itself defective,
producing "[: too many arguments".

20130103T2353Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [545]

20130104T1733Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [544]

Rearrange. Work with riders before specamt, because term rider can
affect some specamt fields.

20130104T1738Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [544]

7702A routines instead of complete specamt vector. Only the lowest
death benefit is relevant anyway. For one particular inforce case,
soon-to-be-replaced 7702A code had treated an impending decrease as
having already occurred, causing an assertion to fire when it did
subsequently occur. Prior to 20120821T0957Z, this had not happened
because historical and future values had been separate inputs.

  dbdict.cpp
  dbdict.hpp
  dbnames.hpp
  dbnames.xpp
  ihs_basicval.cpp
Rearrange and refactor, indicating whether term is a QAB. Combine this
with the death-benefit flag, because those two ways of treating a term
rider are mutually exclusive. Rearrange to show that QAB treatment for
this and other riders is more a 7702 than a rider parameter.

20140504T1633Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net> [542]

  dbdict.cpp
  dbdict.hpp
  dbnames.hpp
  dbnames.xpp
Add database flags to indicate which riders are QABs. It is considered
unlikely that a rider other than term on the main insured would be
treated as a QAB for either 7702 or 7702A but not for both, so each
has only a single flag for both sections of the tax code.

anyway because of the ee payment, so the admin system would simply
have an unneeded extra margin of conservatism.

This change log is no longer updated because git renders it
unnecessary. Use 'git log' to examine changes since the last
entry here. The entire svn history was imported into git, so
'git log' includes the one-line commit messages above, including
even old cvs history that had been imported into svn. This change
log is retained because it contains some commentary outside of
svn commit messages, which could not readily be imported into git.
