MAINTENANCE

Please write entries this way:

[1] YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ <yourname@domain.net> [defect-count]
[2] [this line intentionally left blank]
[3]   filename0
[4]   filename1
[5] Terse comments: full English sentences beginning with a capital
    letter and ending with a period. Prefer bare infinitives:
    "Improve ISO 8601 conformance." instead of "Improved...." or
    "The purpose of this change was to improve....". Single-word
    sentences may be appropriate: "Refactor.".

Limit lines to seventy characters so that they can be quoted and
requoted in email without wrapping.

Explanations:

[1] Write an ISO 8601 timestamp, using UTC because it sorts easily.
Use the actual commit time, so that others can confidently match log
entries against cvs changes. Run 'make check_concinnity' before
committing to cvs: it identifies common problems such as incorrect
copyright statements, and reports the "Number of marked defects" shown
as [defect-count] above.

[3] Exact name of file changed, indented two spaces.

[4] Write each file's name on a separate line. Write them in
alphabetical order.

[5] We aren't exactly following GNU standards here, but this one makes
a lot of sense:
  "If you think that a change calls for explanation, you're probably
  right. Please do explain it--but please put the explanation in
  comments in the code, where people will see it whenever they see the
  code."
If, as is often the case, the cvs commit message alone is sufficient,
then just copy it here.

We started following this convention only on 20050710T0414Z, so don't
take earlier entries as exemplary.

Original checkin.

2005-01-15

  actuarial_table.cpp
  crc32.cpp
  crc32_test.cpp
  data_directory.cpp
  ihs_proddata.cpp
Remove carriage returns.

  elapsed_time.cpp
  system_command.cpp
  system_command.hpp
Add missing RCS Id.

2005-01-16

  sample_cgi_census
Expunge this file, which was a disused artifact.

  build.hpp
  expected.cgi.out
  version.hpp
Add copyright and license notices and RCS Ids to these files, no
matter how trivial they seem. Now every single file in this cvs
directory has these things, creating an invariant that can be
confirmed automatically.

2005-01-27 [1092]

  quoted_gpl
  quoted_gpl_html
Add automatically-generated files for embedding the GPL in other
source, as quoted C strings and html respectively.

  GNUmakefile
  autodependency.make
  configuration.make
  msw_common.make
  msw_cygwin.make
  msw_generic.make
  msw_msys.make
  objects.make
  posix_fhs.make
  workhorse.make
Add makefiles.

2005-01-28 [1104]

Changes necessary to compile with gcc-3.4.2 with no diagnostics:

  config.hpp
  platform_dependent.hpp
Make prototypes of nonstandard functions like putenv() available even
in strict standard-conformance mode.

  GNUmakefile
  argv0.hpp
  diagnostics.sed
  miscellany.hpp
  quiet_nan.hpp
  zero.hpp
All non-configuration headers must include "config.hpp" first. Fix
those that didn't. Add a makefile test for this invariant; refine
other such tests slightly, and improve the sed script that parses
makefile output for diagnostics.

  alert.cpp
Remove a defect marker that called for investigation into a problem
whose cause has been tracked to a libstdc++ defect.

  library_demo.cpp
Don't enforce production-grade security for this mere demo.

  financial_test.cpp
Run timing test once only: it took too long with mpatrol.

  security.cpp
Flush message log on passkey validation failure.

  actuarial_table.cpp
  alert.hpp
  basic_values.hpp
  fenv_lmi.hpp
  ihs_acctval.cpp

  interest_rates.cpp
  ledger_xml_io.cpp
  round_to_test.cpp
  rounding_rules.hpp
  streamable.hpp
  system_command.hpp
  zero.hpp
  zero_test.cpp
Fix other problems diagnosed by gcc-3.4.2, which is stricter than
earlier versions. Use import and export declspec attributes wherever
they make sense: even though it's better not to use them with msw,
they may be useful with gcc-4.x's ELF 'visibility' feature. Remove
superfluous class-name qualifiers from members defined in class
bodies. Factor out duplicative code to manage the floating-point
environment. Other minor changes to improve conformance.

Unit tests do not yet run properly with gcc-3.4.2 and mpatrol, so that
newer compiler version can't yet replace gcc-3.2.3 for production.
However, these changes affect no gcc-3.2.3 test results.

Use stricter gcc warnings. Fix problems indicated by stricter warnings
with gcc-3.4.2--and also with como, which is not yet fully supported.

  inputillus.cpp
Rewrite a block of suspicious code that had seemed to work properly in
the past, but failed with gcc-3.4.2 and mpatrol.

2005-02-03 [1107]

  facets.cpp
Forestall a gcc warning about a slightly unusual line of code already
documented as standard conforming.

  GNUmakefile
  workhorse.make
Use '-g' instead of '-ggdb' because of a MinGW problem documented
inline.

  tn_range_types.hpp
Import these unit-test files from the cvs/lmi/skeleton branch.

  objects.make
Add imported unit tests.

  workhorse.make
Test idempotence of template-instantiation files, which are akin to
headers. Add test targets for the antediluvian branch's cgi-bin and
command-line interfaces.

Now, with gcc-3.4.2 and stricter warning flags: all code compiles with
no diagnostics, except for an unused-parameter warning in one boost
file; all unit tests succeed except for one in a facility slated for
replacement and one that detects standard-library conformance; and
mpatrol with default $(MPATROL_OPTIONS) issues no diagnostic for any
unit test.

  main.cpp
Number of iterations adapts to make self test take about five seconds.
Add several getopt options, implementing only a stub for regression
testing for now.

  mpatrol-mingw-GNUmakefile
Add 'install' target.

Rename ledger classes and files. Merge production branch's ledger
classes into the antediluvian branch. Rename tiered-charge classes and
files. Remove some gratuitous differences between account-value class
branches. Merge, rewrite, and rename death-benefit classes. Extend
self test in 'main.cpp'. Improve antediluvian branch's run time: even
though the production branch's ledger classes are slower, caching
table values makes solves about forty percent faster.

2005-02-13 [1072]

  outlay.cpp
  solve.cpp
Use smart instead of raw pointers to hold resources in some classes,
without fixing the parallel problem in others yet. Rename certain
data members for consistency. Speed of the antediluvian command-line
test is about four percent slower; the degradation is demonstrably
attributable to removal of the hand-written assignment operator and
copy ctor in class BasicValues. The tradeoff is acceptable because
the removed code was not clearly correct, and the implicitly-defined
special member functions bring the system a step closer to exception
safety.

2005-02-16 [1059]

  ledger.cpp
  ledger.hpp
Use smart instead of raw pointers to hold resources in another class,
eliminating hand-written special member functions as above. This
change makes the antediluvian command-line test run twelve percent
faster.

2005-02-17 [1059]

  ledger.hpp
Improve documentation.

  mpatrol_patch_test.cpp
  objects.make
Demonstrate the purpose of a patch submitted to mpatrol, and verify
that it has been applied.

  cgicc-patch-gwc-20050217
Workaround to make cgicc-3.1.4 work with the free, gcc-based MinGW
toolchain on the msw platform. Oddly enough, this GNU package appears
to support that platform only with non-free tools, which lmi users
must not be required to use; the same seems to be true even of the
current release, which however seems even more difficult to compile
with the MinGW toolchain. This casual workaround is not of sufficient
quality to propose as a patch to the maintainer.

  xmlwrapp-patch-gwc-20050217
Fix some oversights and frank errors in xmlwrapp-0.2.0 . It would seem
pointless to submit this patch to the maintainer because several later
versions have been released. It will become obsolete once a later
version of xmlwrapp has been tested.

  msw_common.make
  msw_generic.make
  workhorse.make
Expect to find third-party libraries where the File Hierarchy Standard
would suggest, in /usr/local . On posix systems like GNU/Linux, this
should just work. For msw, it encourages users to adopt a rational
file hierarchy.

  workhorse.make
Add a separate build directory for gprof.

  spew_touchstone
  workhorse.make
Add a test of production-branch account values.

  workhorse.make
Strengthen warning $(CFLAGS) for unit tests.

  GNUmakefile
Prevent 'check_conformity' target from complaining that patches and
testing touchstones don't follow source-code conventions: they
shouldn't.

2005-02-18 [1059]

  GNUmakefile
Add test for current copyright date.

  getopt.cpp
  getopt.hpp
Rewrite copyright statement as 'GNUmakefile' now expects.

  test_tools.hpp
Fix defective typeid comparison.

  alert.cpp
  alert.hpp
  alert_test.cpp
Clear stream buffer and iostate flags after an exception is caught, so
that subsequent alerts are processed correctly. Improve documentation.

  actuarial_table.cpp
Read table length as unsigned. Formerly, tables of size [2^15, 2^16)
bytes elicited a spurious diagnostic, though they were read correctly.

  ihs_proddata.cpp
Prepend directory to filename only once.

  accountvalue.cpp
Implement a hitherto-unneeded member function, to make the production
and antediluvian branches more interchangeable.

  ihs_server7702io.hpp
Fix an oversight in documentation.

  copy_n_.hpp
  is_sorted_.hpp
Use uppercase 'C' in old copyright notices, as FSF recommends.

  GNUmakefile
Add a test for lowercase 'c' in copyright notices. Remove test for
the author's old email address (which has been changed in all sources
already) and add an optional, customizable facility to search for
strings that any particular contributor may wish to prevent from
appearing accidentally in files about to be committed to cvs.

  mc_enum.hpp
  mc_enum.tpp
Make str() public. Add experimental member function allowed_ordinal().

  mc_enum_type_enums.hpp
  mc_enum_types.cpp

  GNUmakefile
Make sure that files embodying the GPL are created as prerequisites.
Check pixmaps for carriage returns; the documented 'xpm' format
doesn't permit embedding copyright and license notices or RCS Ids, and
they typically include tabs, so those things are not checked for.

2005-03-29 [1415]

  account_value.hpp
  census_view.cpp
  ihs_acctval.cpp
Experience rating refinements. Numerator of next year's k factor is
next year's naively-projected COI charge (this year's terminal NAAR
times next year's COI rate) instead of this year's COI charges divided
by one plus this year's k factor. COI charges for experience rating
are yearly totals (without monthly interest), accumulated at an annual
interest rate, instead of a total reflecting monthly interest; while
less exquisitely precise, this is consistent with the way claims are
accumulated, and easier to reproduce from other available columns.
Solves are now explicitly prevented with experience rating: they're
inconsistent with the present parallel accumulation anyway.

  account_value.hpp
  census_view.cpp
  ihs_acctval.cpp
  ihs_avmly.cpp
Display additional information on temporary experience-rating output.

  ihs_acctval.cpp
Suppress side effects of the obsolete experience-rating method.

  xml_notebook.cpp
Add a few lines of code to XmlNotebook::ConditionallyEnableItems(),
as comments only. This represents the only known observable difference
in behavior between cvs HEAD and an offline 20050105T1130Z snapshot
that might have been a cvs branch but was never committed. It's
commented out because it depends on speculative changes elsewhere.

  dbnames.xpp

Improve the OnExceptionInMainLoop() handler, unmasking a wx defect.

2005-03-30 [1415]

Enhance 'Funds' tab. Add 'Reports' tab. Revise 'Group' tab.

  dbnames.xpp
Correct a database entity's description.

  main_wx.cpp
Revert yesterday's change, which now seems to work, possibly due to
some unknown change in wx-2.5.4 . More testing is needed.

  account_value.hpp
  census_view.cpp
  ihs_acctval.cpp
Apportion experience reserve among individuals: even though this is
not the way it's intended to work, it's a precondition of the present
ledger classes that a composite is the weighted sum of individuals.
Suppress the test scaffolding for now unless a particular string
appears in the 'Comments' field; eventually, it'll be removed.

Adjust COI rate for k factor only on current-mortality basis; round
the adjusted COI rate.

  ihs_acctval.cpp
Reimplement net-claims calculation.

  inputs.cpp
Set new default: survive to age 99. Because coverage beyond maturity
is not illustrated, at least for now, this is the most reasonable
default for a composite. It has no effect on individual illustrations.

files are needed, and all concrete implementations can share the same
name, because only one may ever be defined.

  ledger_invariant.cpp

  snprintf_test.cpp
Remove unused headers.

  numeric_io_test.cpp
Replace boost timer with the high-precision timer used for other unit
tests.

  numeric_io_cast.hpp
Correct misleading documentation. The orders-of-magnitude speed
difference formerly cited was measured with mpatrol in use, which
exaggerates the cost of memory allocation.

  numeric_io_test.cpp
Add tests, revealing a latent defect: "0." is a valid floating literal
but incorrectly triggers an exception.

  [no unit test]            tested 'value_cast.hpp'
  'value_cast_test.cpp'     tested 'value_cast_ihs.hpp'
Now, more rationally,
  'value_cast_test.cpp'     tests  'value_cast.hpp'
  'value_cast_test_ihs.cpp' tests  'value_cast_ihs.hpp'
New file 'value_cast_test_ihs.cpp' is old file 'value_cast_test.cpp',
renamed. Contents of old file 'value_cast_test.cpp' are replaced by
code from the skeleton branch, with the addition of some tests from
the suite for 'value_cast_ihs.hpp'.

  ihs_crc_comp.cpp
Catch exceptions in main(), which had abended due to a long-double IO
issue identified when applying the 2005-05-19 changes. Catching
exceptions prevents the abend; the next change (below) prevents the
observed exception from being thrown.

  numeric_io_test.cpp

  GNUmakefile
Incorporate source directory's name in build directory's, in order to
prevent source in distinct sibling directories from incorrectly using
the same build directory.

  objects.make
  workhorse.make
Refactor, making both the lmi and the antediluvian branch use exactly
the same objects for their command-line and cgi-bin drivers. This
demonstrates substitutability of the two branches' calculation
libaries, making it an invariant that's enforced physically and
validated whenever the 'test' target is run.

  workhorse.make
Numerous improvements. The 'install' target runs much faster when
any files to be installed are already up to date. Regression testing
analysis reports certain differences that were previously ignored.
The 'prefix' and 'exec_prefix' variables expected by the GNU coding
standards are now respected. Shared libraries are used by default.

Now, more rationally,
  'any_member_test.cpp'     tests  'any_member.hpp'
  'any_member_test_ihs.cpp' tests  'any_member_ihs.hpp'
New file 'any_member_ihs_test.cpp' is old file 'any_member_test.cpp',
renamed. Contents of old file 'any_member_test.cpp' are replaced by
code from the skeleton branch.

Change default inputs from

to

Users wouldn't be able to turn off a default solve through a GUI
interface that doesn't permit solves, and there was already too much
special-case code to override the former default solve in other cases
where it was inappropriate. It would make no sense to make the default
zero premium: the illustration would lapse instantly, producing a
report that would astonish new users, though a 20000 premium and a
1000000 specified amount are regrettably arbitrary defaults.

  xml_notebook.xrc
Clarify labels for extra loads and charges. These input fields had
been labeled as compensation, which is potentially confusing because
the system doesn't generally calculate compensation. The asset-based
charge applies only to separate-account assets, and it was potentially
confusing not to specify that. Other input skins left unchanged for

Revise treatment of third-party libraries. For libraries with exotic
build procedures (one of which even uses non-free tools), the lmi
makefiles create required objects in the normal way, as always. If
prebuilt libraries are available, as in some GNU/Linux distributions,
defining 'HAVE_THIRD_PARTY_LIBRARIES' skips local compilation. The
latest version of xmlwrapp (not yet tested with lmi) is supported if
'-DUSING_CURRENT_LIBXMLWRAPP' is passed in 'CPPFLAGS' (xmlwrapp has no
way to report its version unless its weird build system is used). The
libxml2 dll import library for msw is now referred to by the name most

  GNUmakefile
Make quoting style consistent. Double quotes might seem preferable for
passing variables requiring expansion to submakefiles, e.g.,
  $(MAKE) -f some-submakefile OPTIONS="$(OPTIONS)" some-target
because that is the usual shell convention; but here gnu make is
passing a makefile variable, for which expansion occurs even within
single quotes. The reason for preferring single quotes is that double
quotes fail horribly in some cases on the msw platform, apparently
because make adds double quotes around the strings that represent
variable definitions when it passes them to submakefiles.

Expunge deprecated input fields representing assumed assets and number
of lives at the case level. They weren't available in any contemporary
input skin. They weren't ever a good idea anyway: accurate values need
the exact assets and number of lives, and the approximations these
fields enabled weren't disclaimed on reports. The original intention
was to make it easy to run a single cell in a case whose cells are
interdependent, e.g., because total case assets determine the level of
the M&E charge. However, exact values should be available, and users
can easily get a similar approximation by running a one-cell census
and manipulating the number of identical lives.

would have the value 12 at year end, but that side effect didn't occur

Change default inputs from

partially reverting the 2005-06-22 change. Reason: input skin
'xml_notebook_private_placement.xrc' has no input field for er
premium, so its users wouldn't be able to change it from 20000 to
zero; somewhat arbitrarily, this rationale regards ee premium as
more 'basic' than er premium, so it's not wholly satisfying.
In 'xml_notebook_single_premium.xrc', map the (one and only)
payment field to ee payment, with the regrettable effect that the
single premium shows up as ee premium on a supplemental report.
This dislikable workaround should be revisited later.

Choice should not have. Many were unrecoverable, and unsafe to bypass.
Many others were certain to produce invalid results. Removed unneeded

message, then throwing a standard exception--is still used in a few
modules that could conceivably be used as standalone libraries.

Correct two errors committed 20051212T1757Z. With these changes, a
static build, i.e.,
  /opt/lmi/bin[0]$./lmi_wx_static --data_path=/opt/lmi/data
works--all the tests hidden on its "Text" menu run correctly--but an
msw dll build abends on tests that throw an exception, because most
exceptions (in the tests, and in practice) cross a dll boundary.

20051213T0443Z <chicares@cox.net> [1212]

  xml_notebook.xrc
Fix some obvious shortcomings. Fields denoting months are deliberately
not constrained to [0, 11], however, even though that could be done
here. Reason: limiting the range for numeric fields generically is an
unimplemented feature that must be implemented in the program rather
than in the xml, and making it appear that this feature has already
been implemented for a few fields is at best a waste of effort and at
worst deceptive. We should erect no Potemkin villages.

  ihs_irc7702a.cpp
Hastily replace an obviously incorrect calculation with another that's
not known to be incorrect, in order to meet an urgent business need.

Optionally build with elf visibility attributes. This is claimed to
have major benefits for posix:
  http://www.nedprod.com/programs/gccvisibility.html
and costs nothing extra to set up because of its similarity to msw
__declspec attributes; but it has not yet been tested on an elf
system, and may need adjustment because the elf and msw attributes
are not syntactically identical.

  configurable_settings.cpp

  inputs.cpp
Add default-input filepath to xml configuration. Remove the former
default-product entity, which this supersedes. This change makes it
imperative to update 'configurable_settings.xml', obligatorily
removing 'default_product', e.g.,
-  <default_product>sample</default_product>
and optionally adding 'default_input_filename', e.g.
+  <default_input_filename>/foo/default.ill</default_input_filename>
with a value that specifies a 'complete' 'file path' with extension
'.ill', according to the definitions here:
  http://boost.org/libs/filesystem/doc/index.htm#Definitions
For GNU/Linux systems, '/etc/opt/lmi/default.ill' is suggested. For
msw, one might use 'x:/d/default.ill' where 'x:' is the drive letter
and '/d/' is some 'directory path'; omitting the drive letter can
cause the "kinky" problem described here:
  http://boost.org/libs/filesystem/doc/operations.htm#system_complete

  xml_notebook.xrc
Partially implement 'EffectiveDateToday'. If that checkbox is checked:
disable 'EffectiveDate'; and set 'EffectiveDate' to the current date,
only when an input file is read. Reading the default-input file counts
as reading an input file. 'EffectiveDate' does not, however, change
when the user checks 'EffectiveDateToday': the planned facility to
force such changes has not yet been implemented. Without this change,
new files created from default input would always bear the default
file's 'EffectiveDate', which would discomfit end users.

Permit use of checkbox with enumerative type 'mce_yes_or_no'. Stronger
consistency checking in the new MVC framework detects this apparent
mismatch. This type was mistakenly created in 2002-05 to facilitate
pasting from a spreadsheet; it would be better to treat 'Yes' and 'No'

Resolve the issues noted 20060712T0511Z. This file is now identical to
the latest revision in the skeleton trunk except for the additional
speed measurements. All tests are passed with gcc, como, and borland.
The overall speed difference is immaterial, as shown by these timings
for gcc, presented in the same format as the test's output:

                     new        old     ratio
  Aggregate    :  4.66E-006  4.69E-006   0.99

  Calculate age:  8.44E-007  1.32E-006   0.64

although the two implementations are obviously tuned differently.

  ihs_avmly.cpp
Fix monthly-report withdrawals; experimentally address a 7702A defect.
Formerly, the last nonzero withdrawal propagated forward into all
future years; now it is set to zero when no withdrawal is taken. This
was evident in the monthly-detail report, but the incorrect value was
disregarded for other reports and for monthiversary processing. It did
however affect 7702A calculations in a way that was the opposite of
conservative.

Import selected changes from skeleton trunk. A notable difference in
behavior is that changes in date and spin controls are recognized only
upon loss of focus. Previously, e.g., typing '1960' into 'DateOfBirth'
a keystroke at a time forced immediate but erratic 'IssueAge' changes:
age became '5' after the first keystroke (because the msw date control
considers '1' to represent 2001), and didn't assume the desired value
of '46' until the last keystroke was typed. Now, the age changes only
after the date control loses focus.

  inputillus.cpp
Synchronize DateOfBirth and IssueAge. Two distinct but interrelated
classes represented input data in the legacy system that lmi replaced.
Changes to one must be reflected in the other, but, defectively, dates
and ages were not always kept consistent. This change complements the
change made 20060623T1814Z, for the opposite order of reflection. Both
classes were copied into lmi for compatibility with other copied code.
Both should be removed: lmi's own MVC Model class handles reflection
of dates and ages, as well as other data relationships, more naturally
and reliably.

Regularize header order and grouping. Coding guidelines shared after
the original changes say:

Group included headers in the following order, sorted alphabetically
within each group, with one blank line between groups.

    * 1 pch file, for '.cpp' files only
    * 2 'config.hpp', for '.hpp' files only
    * 3 class header, only for '.cpp' files that implement a class
          (usually both files have the same name except for the
          '.cpp' versus '.hpp' suffix)
    * 4 files included with #include "..."
    * 5 headers for third-party libraries (use #include <...> here)
    * 6 headers defined in the standard

This unmasks implicit dependencies that can make code appear valid
with a particular compiler when other compilers may properly reject
it. Using #include <...> for case 5 seems at least as good as the
alternative with double quotes; boost chose this policy after much
discussion.

  ledger_text_formats.cpp
  ledger_text_formats.hpp
Rename two data members. Direct use of libxml++ has been sequestered
into 'xml_lmi.?pp', and it seems desirable to keep it so by forbidding
the string 'xmlpp' in any other file, since libxml++'s facilities are
offered through namespace xmlpp.

because 'cvs admin' didn't work on 20061022T0149Z.]

20061022T0208Z <chicares@cox.net> [1162]

Revise documentation.

20061029T0028Z <chicares@cox.net> [1161]

  input_test.cpp
Assert that a pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it. Merely

Show that the function added 20061029T2123Z has negligible overhead:
approximately three percent of total xml read time.

20061029T2128Z <chicares@cox.net> [1161]

  inputillus_xml_io.cpp
Use the function added 20061029T2123Z. The difference in total read
time is so small that its sign can't be determined reliably, probably
because the slight extra overhead is offset by faster iteration.
