Original checkin.

2005-01-15

  actuarial_table.cpp
  crc32.cpp
  crc32_test.cpp
  data_directory.cpp
  ihs_proddata.cpp
Remove carriage returns.

  elapsed_time.cpp
  system_command.cpp
  system_command.hpp
Add missing RCS Id.

2005-01-16

  sample_cgi_census
Expunge this file, which was a disused artifact.

  build.hpp
  expected.cgi.out
  version.hpp
Add copyright and license notices and RCS Ids to these files, no
matter how trivial they seem. Now every single file in this cvs
directory has these things, creating an invariant that can be
confirmed automatically.

2005-01-27 [1092]

  quoted_gpl
  quoted_gpl_html
Add automatically-generated files for embedding the GPL in other
source, as quoted C strings and html respectively.

  GNUmakefile
  autodependency.make
  configuration.make
  msw_common.make
  msw_cygwin.make
  msw_generic.make
  msw_msys.make
  objects.make
  posix_fhs.make
  workhorse.make
Add makefiles.

2005-01-28 [1104]

Changes necessary to compile with gcc-3.4.2 with no diagnostics:

  config.hpp
  platform_dependent.hpp
Make prototypes of nonstandard functions like putenv() available even
in strict standard-conformance mode.

  GNUmakefile
  argv0.hpp
  diagnostics.sed
  miscellany.hpp
  quiet_nan.hpp
  zero.hpp
All non-configuration headers must include "config.hpp" first. Fix
those that didn't. Add a makefile test for this invariant; refine
other such tests slightly, and improve the sed script that parses
makefile output for diagnostics.

  alert.cpp
Remove a defect marker that called for investigation into a problem
whose cause has been tracked to a libstdc++ defect.

  library_demo.cpp
Don't enforce production-grade security for this mere demo.

  financial_test.cpp
Run timing test once only: it took too long with mpatrol.

  security.cpp
Flush message log on passkey validation failure.

  actuarial_table.cpp
  alert.hpp
  basic_values.hpp
  fenv_lmi.hpp
  ihs_acctval.cpp
  ihs_basicval.cpp
  ihs_funddata.hpp
  ihs_ldginvar.cpp
  input_test.cpp
  inputillus.cpp
  inputillus.hpp
  interest_rates.cpp
  ledger_xml_io.cpp
  round_to_test.cpp
  rounding_rules.hpp
  streamable.hpp
  system_command.hpp
  zero.hpp
  zero_test.cpp
Fix other problems diagnosed by gcc-3.4.2, which is stricter than
earlier versions. Use import and export declspec attributes wherever
they make sense: even though it's better not to use them with msw,
they may be useful with gcc-4.x's ELF 'visibility' feature. Remove
superfluous class-name qualifiers from members defined in class
bodies. Factor out duplicative code to manage the floating-point
environment. Other minor changes to improve conformance.

Unit tests do not yet run properly with gcc-3.4.2 and mpatrol, so that
newer compiler version can't yet replace gcc-3.2.3 for production.
However, these changes affect no gcc-3.2.3 test results.

  workhorse.make
Use stricter gcc warnings. Fix problems indicated by stricter warnings
with gcc-3.4.2--and also with como, which is not yet fully supported.

  inputillus.cpp
Rewrite a block of suspicious code that had seemed to work properly in
the past, but failed with gcc-3.4.2 and mpatrol. Now, with gcc-3.4.2
and stricter warning flags: all code compiles with no diagnostics,
except for an unused-parameter warning in one boost file; all unit
tests succeed except for one in a facility slated for replacement; and
mpatrol with default $(MPATROL_OPTIONS) issues no diagnostic for any
unit test.
