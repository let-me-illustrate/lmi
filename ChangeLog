Original checkin.

2005-01-15

  actuarial_table.cpp
  crc32.cpp
  crc32_test.cpp
  data_directory.cpp
  ihs_proddata.cpp
Remove carriage returns.

  elapsed_time.cpp
  system_command.cpp
  system_command.hpp
Add missing RCS Id.

2005-01-16

  sample_cgi_census
Expunge this file, which was a disused artifact.

  build.hpp
  expected.cgi.out
  version.hpp
Add copyright and license notices and RCS Ids to these files, no
matter how trivial they seem. Now every single file in this cvs
directory has these things, creating an invariant that can be
confirmed automatically.

2005-01-27 [1092]

  quoted_gpl
  quoted_gpl_html
Add automatically-generated files for embedding the GPL in other
source, as quoted C strings and html respectively.

  GNUmakefile
  autodependency.make
  configuration.make
  msw_common.make
  msw_cygwin.make
  msw_generic.make
  msw_msys.make
  objects.make
  posix_fhs.make
  workhorse.make
Add makefiles.

2005-01-28 [1104]

Changes necessary to compile with gcc-3.4.2 with no diagnostics:

  config.hpp
  platform_dependent.hpp
Make prototypes of nonstandard functions like putenv() available even
in strict standard-conformance mode.

  GNUmakefile
  argv0.hpp
  diagnostics.sed
  miscellany.hpp
  quiet_nan.hpp
  zero.hpp
All non-configuration headers must include "config.hpp" first. Fix
those that didn't. Add a makefile test for this invariant; refine
other such tests slightly, and improve the sed script that parses
makefile output for diagnostics.

  alert.cpp
Remove a defect marker that called for investigation into a problem
whose cause has been tracked to a libstdc++ defect.

  library_demo.cpp
Don't enforce production-grade security for this mere demo.

  financial_test.cpp
Run timing test once only: it took too long with mpatrol.

  security.cpp
Flush message log on passkey validation failure.

  actuarial_table.cpp
  alert.hpp
  basic_values.hpp
  fenv_lmi.hpp
  ihs_acctval.cpp
  ihs_basicval.cpp
  ihs_funddata.hpp
  ihs_ldginvar.cpp
  input_test.cpp
  inputillus.cpp
  inputillus.hpp
  interest_rates.cpp
  ledger_xml_io.cpp
  round_to_test.cpp
  rounding_rules.hpp
  streamable.hpp
  system_command.hpp
  zero.hpp
  zero_test.cpp
Fix other problems diagnosed by gcc-3.4.2, which is stricter than
earlier versions. Use import and export declspec attributes wherever
they make sense: even though it's better not to use them with msw,
they may be useful with gcc-4.x's ELF 'visibility' feature. Remove
superfluous class-name qualifiers from members defined in class
bodies. Factor out duplicative code to manage the floating-point
environment. Other minor changes to improve conformance.

Unit tests do not yet run properly with gcc-3.4.2 and mpatrol, so that
newer compiler version can't yet replace gcc-3.2.3 for production.
However, these changes affect no gcc-3.2.3 test results.

  workhorse.make
Use stricter gcc warnings. Fix problems indicated by stricter warnings
with gcc-3.4.2--and also with como, which is not yet fully supported.

  inputillus.cpp
Rewrite a block of suspicious code that had seemed to work properly in
the past, but failed with gcc-3.4.2 and mpatrol.

2005-02-03 [1107]

  facets.cpp
Forestall a gcc warning about a slightly unusual line of code already
documented as standard conforming.

  GNUmakefile
  workhorse.make
Use '-g' instead of '-ggdb' because of a MinGW problem documented
inline.  

  materially_equal.hpp
Reformat for clarity.

  tn_range_types.cpp
  tn_range_types.hpp
Import these unit-test files from the cvs/lmi/skeleton branch.

  objects.make
Add imported unit tests.

  workhorse.make
Test idempotence of template-instantiation files, which are akin to
headers. Add test targets for the antediluvian branch's cgi-bin and
command-line interfaces.

Now, with gcc-3.4.2 and stricter warning flags: all code compiles with
no diagnostics, except for an unused-parameter warning in one boost
file; all unit tests succeed except for one in a facility slated for
replacement and one that detects standard-library conformance; and
mpatrol with default $(MPATROL_OPTIONS) issues no diagnostic for any
unit test.

  main.cpp
Number of iterations adapts to make self test take about five seconds.
Add several getopt options, implementing only a stub for regression
testing for now.

  mpatrol-mingw-GNUmakefile
Add 'install' target.

Add default catch-anything clause.

Add several database entities.

  expected.cgi.out

Rename ledger classes and files. Merge production branch's ledger
classes into the antediluvian branch. Rename tiered-charge classes and
files. Remove some gratuitous differences between account-value class
branches. Merge, rewrite, and rename death-benefit classes. Extend
self test in 'main.cpp'. Improve antediluvian branch's run time: even
though the production branch's ledger classes are slower, caching
table values makes solves about forty percent faster.

As appropriate: obstruct slicing, making the dtor nonvirtual; use
boost::noncopyable, preferring it to writing a private copy ctor and
assignment operator and documenting them as unimplemented.

  outlay.cpp
  solve.cpp
Use smart instead of raw pointers to hold resources in some classes,
without fixing the parallel problem in others yet. Rename certain
data members for consistency. Speed of the antediluvian command-line
test is about four percent slower; the degradation is demonstrably
attributable to removal of the hand-written assignment operator and
copy ctor in class BasicValues. The tradeoff is acceptable because
the removed code was not clearly correct, and the implicitly-defined
special member functions bring the system a step closer to exception
safety.
