<h3>Working with sequence input</h3>

<p>
Sometimes input amounts need to change from one year to the next.
</p>
<p>
<img src="ellipsis.png" alt="[ellipsis.png]">
&nbsp;
You see this button at the right end of each field that can vary by
duration. Press it to enter a sequence of values. A dialog like this
pops up:
</p>
<p>
<img src="sequence_editor.png" width="610" height="226" alt="[screenshot]">
</p>
<p>
You don&rsquo;t have to remember keywords like <samp>sevenpay</samp>
and <samp>retirement</samp>&mdash;just pick them from the drop-down
lists.
</p>
<p>
When you click <samp>OK</samp>, the dialog closes, and you see the
sequence in a compact mathematical form:
</p>
<pre>
        sevenpay 7; 250000 retirement; 100000 #10; 75000 @95; 50000
</pre>
<p>
If you wish, you can enter sequences in that form yourself.
Here&rsquo;s how.
</p>
<p>
When values change every year, separate them with semicolons.
If the face amount starts at $100,000 and goes up $10,000 every year
for five years, type
</p>
<pre>
        100000; 110000; 120000; 130000; 140000; 150000
</pre>
<p>
The last value repeats until the end, as you&rsquo;d expect.
It doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;run out of numbers&rdquo; and drop to zero.
In this case, the face amount stays at $150,000 until maturity.
</p>
<p>
You can type spaces if you like, or leave them out.
But don&rsquo;t write a dollar sign, and don&rsquo;t separate
thousands with commas.
Not every country uses dollars, and some write a comma after every
fourth digit.
</p>
<p>
Values can vary even if they aren&rsquo;t numbers.
For instance, a payment mode of
</p>
<pre>
        annual; monthly
</pre>
<p>
means annual in the first year, and monthly thereafter.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you want to pay a $10,000 premium every year for the first
twenty policy years, and then stop.
You don&rsquo;t have to type the number twenty times.
Just say
</p>
<pre>
        10000 20; 0
</pre>
<p>
Remember to put a zero at the end, because the last value repeats.
</p>
<p>
To pay $10,000 a year for the first ten policy years, then $5,000
a year until the end of the fifteenth year, type
</p>
<pre>
        10000 10; 5000 15; 0
</pre>
<p>
You may want to enter payments that depend on attained age.
Type
</p>
<pre>
        10000 @70; 0
</pre>
<p>
to pay $10,000 every year until age 70.
You can even make that the
<a href="group_tutorial.html#how_census_defaults">default</a>
payment pattern for a whole group.
It means a different number of years for different issue ages.
Or you can make the pattern use retirement age: type
</p>
<pre>
        10000 retirement; 0
</pre>
<p>
to pay $10,000 until retirement.
To take a $5,000 withdrawal each year after retirement, type
</p>
<pre>
        0 retirement; 5000
</pre>
<p>
You can also say
</p>
<pre>
        0 retirement; 5000 maturity
</pre>
<p>
if you want to spell it all out.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes you want a value to apply for a certain number of years.
Type
</p>
<pre>
        0 retirement; 5000 #10; 0
</pre>
<p>
to get a withdrawal of $5,000 for ten years, no matter when retirement
starts.
</p>
<p>
As that example shows, you can mix different ways of saying what
periods of time you mean.
Read it piece by piece:
</p>
<pre>
        0 retirement
</pre>
<p>
means &ldquo;zero until retirement&rdquo;, and then
</p>
<pre>
        5000 #10
</pre>
<p>
means &ldquo;$5,000 a year for the next ten years&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
Whatever way you enter a sequence, error messages show it in a
standard mathematical notation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
&lsquo;[&rsquo; and &lsquo;]&rsquo; begin and end an interval,
including the endpoints.
</li>
<li>
&lsquo;(&rsquo; and &lsquo;)&rsquo; begin and end an interval,
excluding the endpoints.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can use that notation yourself if you want.
For example, you can write the last example above as
</p>
<pre>
        0,[0,retirement);10000,[retirement,#10);0
</pre>
<p>
Remember:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The last value repeats, because that&rsquo;s usually what you want.
Make the last value zero if that&rsquo;s what you mean.
</li>
<li>
&lsquo;#&rsquo; means &ldquo;for some number of years&rdquo;, so
<kbd>#10</kbd> means for the next ten years.
</li>
<li>
&lsquo;@&rsquo; means &ldquo;until some attained age&rdquo;, so
<kbd>@65</kbd> means until age 65.
</li>
<li>
A duration with no &lsquo;#&rsquo; or &lsquo;@&rsquo; means
&ldquo;until some policy anniversary&rdquo;,
so a payment mode of <kbd>monthly 10; annual</kbd>
means monthly until the end of the tenth policy year, then annual.
</li>
</ul>
