/// Calculate premium tax, particularly when passed through as a load.
///
/// Scalar and tiered rates are deliberately maintained in the product
/// files so that they can be readily examined, transferred to other
/// systems, and overridden if desired. The values hardcoded here and
/// used as defaults in product files are generally appropriate, but
/// subject to interpretation because some states impose assessments
/// in addition to their nominal tax rates.
///
/// Retaliation is handled in the code, so rates specified in the
/// product database shouldn't reflect retaliation. (If they did, then
/// different rates would be needed for different domiciles.)
///
/// The product database distinguishes premium-tax loads from rates:
/// 'DB_PremTaxLoad' is the load charged by the insurer against the
/// contract, while 'DB_PremTaxRate' is the tax rate levied by the
/// state upon the insurer.
///
/// At present, however, '.strata' files contain only the (tiered) tax
/// rates: there are no distinct tiered tax loads.
///
/// Despite that limitation, the correct answer is obtained for the
/// two cases that have arisen in practice. In the first case, the
/// premium-tax load doesn't vary by state--perhaps a flat load such
/// as two percent is used, or maybe zero percent with premium-tax
/// expense covered elsewhere in pricing--and tiering is ignored, so
/// the tax load is simply that scalar. In the second case, the exact
/// premium tax is passed through, so the load equals the tax rate.
///
/// Known shortcomings.
///
/// Default values and brackets for tiered rates should be moved here
/// from 'stratified_charges.cpp', in order to keep all premium-tax
/// information in one place.
///
/// The physical complexity should be reduced by adding a new ctor
/// that takes as arguments the actual values and brackets read from
/// the '.strata' and '.database' files, and implementing the existing
/// ctors in a TU of their own. This would probably suggest physical
/// improvements to classes Loads and load_details.
///
/// Once actual values and brackets read from '.strata' files have
/// been copied here, and portions of 'stratified_charges.cpp' moved
/// here, retaliation can be made more correct in "tiered" states.
/// AK and SD retaliate with respect to their initial bands only, but
/// such retaliation is for now presumed not to occur, so AK and SD
/// domiciles are not supported. Furthermore, retaliation against AK
/// and SD contracts is not supported, so premium tax is understated
/// for a few domiciles.
///
/// start_new_year() should be improved as noted in its documentation.
///
/// premium_tax_rates_for_annuities() should be implemented.
