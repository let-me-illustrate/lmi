# This sample usage:
#   ./local_options mingw_dir=/MinGW-20050120/ CFLAGS='-g -O0'
# creates a file 'local_options.make' that contains
#   local_options += mingw_dir='/MinGW-20050120/'
#   local_options += CFLAGS='-g -O0'
# which is included by 'GNUmakefile', which passes those options to
# submakefiles. This is purely a convenience: the same result would
# be obtained by invoking 'make' with the same arguments.
#
# Naturally, any option containing whitespace must be quoted.
#
# Any variable defined here is overridden by any definition of the
# same variable on the 'make' command line. Thus, in the example
# above, if make is invoked as
#   make CFLAGS='-Wall'
# then the value '-g -O0' in 'local_options.make' is ignored and
# '-Wall' is used instead.
#
# It is not suggested that this is a good way of managing options in
# general. The section "Variables from the Environment" in the GNU
# 'make' manual describes a substantially similar way of handling
# options; all the warnings given there apply to this technique, too.
#
# One reasonable use is to supply a persistent local definition of
# $(mingw_dir), in order to avoid the problem described here:
