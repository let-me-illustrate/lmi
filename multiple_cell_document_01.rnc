# Use file extension '.cns' for multiple-life xml documents.

# This schema corresponds to version 1 of class multiple_cell_document.

# Inforce data from external systems must include 'case_default' and
# 'class_defaults'; but those elements wouldn't be expected to have
# any analogue on an administration system, so it seems best to copy
# them from this document:
#   http://svn.savannah.nongnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/lmi/trunk/sample.cns?revision=5721&root=lmi
# overwriting its 'particular_cells' with the individual records of
# all contracts in the group.

start = element multiple_cell_document
    {attribute version {"1"}
    ,## Optional for now; to be required in the future.
     attribute data_source {xsd:nonNegativeInteger}?
