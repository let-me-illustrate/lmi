/// Design modified 2021-05-05: Formerly, lmi's default inputs
///   1,000,000 specamt
///      20,000 pmts
/// were simply multiplied by one thousand, to test ledger scaling
/// for enormous amounts. Due to a recent lmi change, the ratio of
/// those numbers would raise an alarum when used with a default
/// product for which
///   oe_min_single_premium_corr_mult == MinSinglePremiumType
/// To prevent that, changed the payment from $20M to $950M. Paying
/// $950M every year is of course absurd, but it's a good test of
/// ledger scaling.
