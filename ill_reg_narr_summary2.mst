{{#GroupExperienceRating}}
    <p>
    We may assess a Market Value Adjustment upon a surrender
    of the certificate when the surrender proceeds are intended
    to be applied to an insurance policy issued by an insurer
    unaffiliated with
    {{InsCoShortName}}
    with an intent to qualify the exchange as a tax free exchange
    under IRC section 1035.

    {{^UseExperienceRating}}

        This illustration does not reflect experience rating.

    {{/UseExperienceRating}}

    <p>
    The guaranteed values reflect the maximum charges permitted
    by the contract, which may include an Experience Rating
    Risk Charge.
    </p>

    <p>
    No Experience Rating Risk Charge or a distribution
    of an Experience Rating Reserve Credit is reflected
    in the current, non-guaranteed values. Actual charges
    and credits will be based on the actual experience of the group.
    </p>

{{#Has1035ExchCharge}}
    <p>
    {{^SinglePremium}}
        Upon surrender of this policy, where the surrender
        proceeds are intended to be applied to an insurance policy
        or certificate issued in conjunction with an intent
        to qualify the exchange as a tax free exchange
        under Section 1035 of the Internal Revenue Code,
        we may assess an Exchange Charge. The Exchange Charge
        is the greater of the Market Value Adjustment Charge
        and the Percentage of Premium Charge. In the states
        of Florida or Indiana, the Exchange charge
        (referred to as Assignment Charge in Florida)
        will be the Percentage of Premium Charge only.
        The Exchange Charge will potentially reduce
        the surrender proceeds, but will never increase
        the surrender proceeds. Please refer to your policy
        for details.
    {{/SinglePremium}}

        Exchange), we may assess an Exchange Charge. The Exchange
        Charge will potentially reduce the surrender proceeds,
        but will never increase the surrender proceeds.
