// Gregory W. Chicares modified it in 2004 to make it independent of
// the boost directory structure, and in any other ways indicated
// below, and in any later years shown above. Any defect in it should
// not reflect on Beman Dawes's reputation.

// The original boost.org test library upon which this derived work is
// based was later replaced by a very different library. That new test
// library has more features but is less transparent; it is not
// strictly compatible with tests written for the original library;
// and, for boost-1.31.0 at least, it didn't work out of the box with
// the latest como compiler. The extra features don't seem to be worth
// the cost.
//
// It seems unwise to mix boost versions, and better to extract this
// library from boost-1.23.0 and remove its dependencies on other
// parts of boost, which is easy to do because, as Beman Dawes says:
// Header dependencies are deliberately restricted to reduce coupling.

// boost/test_main.cpp (header or not, as you like it) ----------------------//
//
// This file may be included as a header file, or may be compiled and placed
// in a library for traditional linking. It is unusual for non-template
// non-inline implementation code to be used as a header file, but the user
// may elect to do so because header-only implementation requires no library
// build support. (Suggested by Ed Brey)
