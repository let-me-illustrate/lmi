/// Return outcome of a trial with a given input value.

/// Naively, one might run an illustration for a given input, and
/// return the difference between actual and target CSV at the
/// specified target duration. However, if the policy lapsed before
/// that duration, this naive approach would return zero. That's not
/// desirable: even if it leads to a valid answer, it provides little
/// information that the solve routine can use to refine the input
/// value. Instead, therefore, certain steps are taken to make the
/// objective function more tractable as its value approaches zero
/// from either direction:
///
/// 1. Prevent the policy from lapsing during a solve, by setting the
/// AccountValue::Solving flag.
///
/// 2. Ascertain the lowest negative CSV over the solve period, if
/// any, excluding any duration at which a no-lapse guarantee is in
/// effect.
///
/// 3. Ascertain the greatest ullage (any positive excess of requested
/// over maximum) throughout the solve period in
///  - loan, or
///  - withdrawal
/// but ignoring any no-lapse provision (which wouldn't override
/// internal limits on these amounts); and negate it for use as an
/// objective-function penalty quite like negative CSV.
///
/// 4. If either 2. or 3. is negative, return the difference between
/// whichever of them is more negative and the target value; else
/// return the difference between the target and actual values at the
/// solve target duration, the "actual" value being CSV in general,
/// but NAAR in the case of NAAR solves. (Non-MEC solves (v.i.) return
/// something altogether different.)
///
/// In all cases, solves use the same CSV as lapse processing, which
/// is not always the same as the CSV printed on an illustration. For
/// example, any sales-load refund increases the value for which the
/// contract can be surrendered, but does not prevent lapse. (NAAR
/// solves use AV rather than CSV in the second part of step 4 above.)
///
/// "Solve for endowment" is deemed to mean that CSV equals specified
/// amount at the target duration, so the target value is the same for
/// all death benefit options.
///
/// NAAR solves work the same way as CSV solves up to step 4's "else"
/// clause, where they return the difference between the target value
/// and the NAAR at the target duration. For this purpose, NAAR is
/// defined as (DB-AV) at EOY: the difference between the DB and AV
/// columns printed on an illustration, which is what agents expect.
/// This is not the same as the NAAR used in calculating COI charges,
/// which discounts the EOM DB for one month's guaranteed interest and
/// subtracts BOM AV.
///
/// Non-MEC solves use an extremely simple objective function that
/// disregards any input target value or duration. The duration is
/// implicitly the maturity date: all that matters is whether the
/// contract ever becomes a MEC. The result is naturally a boundary
/// value, so it is not interesting to compare it to any solve input.
///
/// Non-MEC solves for loan or withdrawal are untested because they
/// probably make no sense--see:
///   https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/lmi/2009-02/msg00028.html
/// so perhaps they should be prohibited.
///
/// Non-MEC solves seem acceptably fast despite this two-valued step
/// function. Other options considered include:
///  - Use MEC duration. This inserts a monotone segment into the
///    function in a one-sided neighborhood of the "root" sought.
///    Experiments suggest that this is a pessimization: the monotone
///    segment is rather short, and reaching a point on it causes
///    Brent's algorithm to choose a linear or quadratic interpolation
///    when bisection would actually converge faster.
///  - Minimize the difference between DCV and NSP, subject to not
///    violating the seven-pay limit. The possible improvement in
///    performance does not seem to justify the complexity: e.g.,
///    there is no obvious way to combine the two criteria into one
///    function whose "root" can be found rapidly. Such an objective
///    function would depend on how the necessary-premium exception
///    is applied, if at all; and of course it would be inappropriate
///    for GPT contracts.
/// Alternatively, MEC avoidance could have been treated not as a
/// distinct solve species but rather as a constraint optionally
/// superimposed on other solves; but that would lead to a more
/// general optimization problem.
///
/// When solving for illustration-reg guaranteed premium for a GPT
/// contract, guideline premium limitations are suspended (in code
/// found elsewhere). Thus, the intention of state law is realized by
/// overlooking the very real possibility of a conflict with federal
/// law. See NAIC Q&A 7.9:
///   http://www.naic.org/committe/modelaws/liiq&a.htm
///   "Section 7B(2) does not preclude the illustrating of premiums
///   that exceed the guideline premiums in Section 7702 of the IRC."
