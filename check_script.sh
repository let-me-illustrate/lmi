shebang="$(sed -e'1!d' -e's/ .*$//' "$1")"

# For scripts beginning with '#!/bin/zsh', a pipeline changes that
# hashbang to '#!/bin/ksh' and feeds the result into shellcheck
# because shellcheck doesn't support zsh but does support ksh.
# In that case, any errors are reported as occurring in file '-',
# so the command below writes the name of the zsh script after any
# error messages.
#
# A fancier alternative might postprocess shellcheck output thus:
#  | sed -e"/^In - line [0-9]*:$/s/-/$1"
# but that would be harder to maintain, and more fragile because
# the format of shellcheck's output might change in future.
