# Limited workarounds for Comeau C++ version 4.3.3, using gcc as the
# underlying C compiler, with a Cygwin shell. Comeau C++ is useful
# because it conforms to the standard in some ways that gcc does not,
# so using it at least for unit tests may reveal defects not found
# with gcc alone.

# SOMEDAY !! Address these shortcomings:
#
# Comeau C++ builds are not idempotent. This command
#   make -f como_4_3_3.make unit_tests
# succeeds when the build directory is empty, but reissuing exactly
# the same command produces linker errors.
#
# Apparently those errors are due to template-instantiation conflicts.
# Untested ideas:
#  - use '-T'
#  - routinely delete '.ii' files
#  - use a monolithic library for all code shared by unit tests
#  - use a distinct subdirectory for each target
# Cf.:
# http://www-d0.fnal.gov/KAI/doc/UserGuide/faq.html#multiple_template_instance
