/// Elasticity and clipping
///
/// Most columns are inelastic: they have a fixed minimum width and
/// are not clipped lest crucial information (e.g., part of a number)
/// be lost. The archetypal elastic column is a personal name, whose
/// width is practically unlimited and might even exceed the total page
/// width; it is better to truncate one extremely long personal name
/// than to present an error message and produce no report at all.
///
/// An ideal report generator might call GetTextExtent() on every row
/// of data to determine a column's ideal width, but this one favors
/// speed by setting a presumptive maximum width for each column.
/// Therefore, it treats a personal-name column as having no natural
/// width at all. Its minimum width might be set equal to its header
/// width, but such a refinement is needless in the problem domain. In
/// the most extreme case, all inelastic columns would fit, but there
/// would be not a single pixel available for elastic columns, which
/// would all in effect be dropped; again, in the problem domain, that
/// would actually be preferable to failing to produce any output.
///
/// Therefore, elastic columns are clipped, and inelastic ones are not.
/// All other column properties are independent, and specified by
/// arguments, but clipping depends on the elasticity argument. It is
/// distinguished only because clipping is a distinct layout operation.
///
///  - is_elastic(): An elastic column has no innate fixed or preferred
///    width. After all inelastic columns have claimed their required
///    widths, any remaining width available is prorated among elastic
///    columns, which therefore may be wider than their widest contents
///    or narrower than their narrowest. As a consequence, elastic
///    columns are clipped--vide supra.
///
///  - is_clipped(): A clipped column is truncated to fit its allotted
///    space. Only elastic columns are clipped--vide supra.

/// Nomenclature:
///  - A 'line' is a printable zone of unit height.
///  - A 'row' is a series of data to be shown side by side.
///  - A 'full' page has as many complete groups of rows as can fit,
///    and nothing more. All pages except the last are always full;
///    the last may also happen to be full.
///  - The 'last' page is the one with the highest page number. It may
///    have exactly as many rows as any 'full' page (if the cardinality
///    of the data is congruent to zero (mod rows_per_group)); or
///    fewer, as is naturally most common; or more, if a final partial
///    group is displayed on the last page to avoid widowing.
/// If a table prints on a single page, then the first is a 'last'
/// page; it may or may not be full.
///
/// With quinquennial spacing, the Morse alphabet is printed thus:
///
///   A   .-     line  0   row  0
///   B   -...   line  1   row  1
///   C   -.-.   line  2   row  2
///   D   -..    line  3   row  3
///   E   .      line  4   row  4
///   [blank]    line  5
///   F   ..-.   line  6   row  5
///   G   --.    line  7   row  6
///   ...
///   Z   --..   line 30   row 25
///
/// with a page length of 50 lines. With a page length of 25 lines,
/// the first page would end with
///   T   -      line 22   row 19
/// and the second page would be printed thus:
///
///   U   ..-    line  0   row 20
