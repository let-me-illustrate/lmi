/// The MultiDimGrid control can be used to edit N-dimensional data tables.
/// The data is represented by MultiDimTable which is a table indexed by
/// arbitrary many axis. Each axis has a finite, discrete number of values
/// which can be
///      - of string type, in which case they must be listed explicitely
///      - of int type in which case the values are specified by a range
///        min..max with the given step (1 by default)
///      - of any other custom type, in that case axis must provide conversion
///        from/to the string representation of a value
///
/// MultiDimTable is an ABC and has to be implemented by the application to
/// provide the link between its internal data representation and the GUI
/// control.
///
/// As an added twist, each of the classes here is available in two versions:
///      - type-unsafe but template-less version using boost::any and thus
///        capable of containing any, possibly even heterogeneous, values;
///        these classes are called FooAny below
///      - type-safe version requiring to specify the value and axis types
///        during compile-time: this is more restrictive but is much safer so,
///        whenever possible, these FooN (where N = 0, 1, ...) classes should
///        be used.

/// Adjustment windows in MultiDimGrid
///
/// Adjustment window is bound to an axis and is used to modify (adjust) axis
/// value range, which in return will adjust the domain of the data stored
/// in the underlying table. It is an optional control and should be used
/// only for mutable axis.
///
/// Adjustment window is created by a MultiDimAxis and is owned by MultiDimGrid
///
/// There are two processes invlving adjustment windows:
///   - refreshing of axis value range and its adjustment window
///     to stay syncronised with MultiDimGrid actual value-domain. It is
///     triggered by MultiDimGrid::ApplyAxisAdjustment().
///   - applying adjustments made by the user through an adjustment control to
///     the  MultiDimTable. Triggered by MultiDimGrid::RefreshAxisAdjustment().
/// Both MultiDimGrid::ApplyAxisAdjustment() and
/// MultiDimGrid::RefreshAxisAdjustment() are two step methods.
/// MultiDimGrid::ApplyAxisAdjustment() :
///   - apply adjustment from adjustment window to its axis
///     MultiDimAxisAny::ApplyAdjustment()
///   - apply adjustment from the axis to the data-table
///     MultiDimTableAny::ApplyAxisAdjustment()
///
/// MultiDimGrid::RefreshAxisAdjustment() :
///   - refresh the values shown for an axis
///     MultiDimTableAny::RefreshAxisAdjustment()
///   - refresh adjustment window from the axis
///     MultiDimAxisAny::RefreshAdjustment()

/// Axis choice windows in MultiDimGrid
///
/// Axis choice is UI window allowing the user to choose a specific value for
/// the axis. It is created by the MultiDimAxis and is required.
///
/// "Mutable axis" needs to update its choice control to reflect changes
/// in its value range.
///
/// The default implementation of axis choice control is a drop down list of
/// axis values. When a value is chosen the control should trigger
/// MultiDimGrid::FixAxisValue() method to notify the grid about axis value
/// change.

/// Design notes for MultiDimAxisAny
///
/// Base class representing any axis in a multidimensional data table.
///
/// This is an ABC, concrete classes derived from it are
///   - MultiDimEnumAxis for sets of strings
///   - MultiDimIntAxis for ranges of integers
///
/// Other classes (e.g. a date axis) may be derived by the user code if
/// necessary.
///
/// MultiDimAxisAny(name): the name of this axis, returned by GetName()
///
/// GetName(): This is the axis name shown in the UI for axis choice
/// and so it should be user-readable (in particular translated if needed).
///
/// GetCardinality(): Return the number of values of this axis. This is
/// used to show the appropriate number of columns/rows for this axis.
/// The number of values should be strictly greater than 1.
///
/// GetLabel(n): Return the user-readable string representation of the N-th
/// axis value.
/// This is used for the column or row labels in the UI and so should be
/// translated if appropriate.
///   - n is the value between 0 and GetCardinality()-1
///   - returns label for this value
///
/// GetValue(n): Return the underlying value for the given axis label.
/// The label shown in the UI corresponds to a value of the underlying data
/// type which is used internally and this function is used to establish
/// this correspondence.
///   - n the value between 0 and GetCardinality()-1
///   - returns the value corresponding to this index
///
/// GetChoiceControl(grid, table): Create the control for choosing the value
/// for this axis.
/// This method is used to create the GUI control allowing to choose fixed
/// value of this axis (when it is not selected as one of the grid axis).
/// The base class version return a wxChoice control and fills it with the
/// results of calls to GetLabel() but this may be overridden to create any
/// other kind of control.
/// When the selection in this control changes, FixAxisValue() method of
/// the grid object should be called to refresh the display (this is done
/// automatically by the combobox created by the default implementation but
/// has to be done manually otherwise).
///   - grid the grid control this axis is used with
///   - table data-table object, the creator of this axis, optional parameter
///     to help non-trivial implementations to keep track of table-axis links.
///     It is not used in default implementation
///   - returns the control to select value of this axis, must not be NULL
///
/// UpdateChoiceControl(choice_control): Update the content of the value
/// choice control of the axis.
/// This method is used to update the axis choice control when there are
/// any changes made to the axis itself. When adjustable axis is changed
/// the MultiDimGrid will cal this method asking the axis to reflect
/// the changes in the choice control widget.
/// The default wxChoice control implementation does the refresh by simply
/// repopulating the choice control. If GetChoiceControl() method returns
/// any other custoim widget and the axis is adjustable then this method
/// should be manually overriden.
///   - choice_control the axis choice control previously created
//      by GetChoiceControl()
///
/// GetAdjustControl(grid, table): Create the control to adjust the axis
/// value range.
/// This control is used by an axis when it allows the user to change its
/// value range in some way during the runtime (imagine an integer axis
/// with values in a range with variable upper bound).
/// The default version of the method returns NULL indicating
/// that the axis (and its value range) is immutable.
/// See also ApplyAdjustment, RefreshAdjustment
///   - grid the grid control this axis is used with
///   - table the underlying data table object
///   - returns the adjustment control for the axis or NULL if none
///
/// ApplyAdjustment(axis_window, n): Read and apply adjustment from
/// its adjustment control.
/// Method is called from the adjustment control (see also GetAdjustControl())
/// when the user wants to alter the axis value range. The MultiDimGrid triggers
/// a chain of updates:
///   - from adjustment control to axis object (this method)
///   - from axis object to the data table object
///     (MultiDimTableAny::ApplyAxisAdjustment)
///   - some updates on its internal widgets to refresh the shown data
/// The method is responsible for updating the internal axis value range
/// from the adjustment control.
