// The valuable idea of associating immutable arrays with a class
// as non-type template parameters was taken from an article in
// comp.lang.c++.moderated by Hyman Rosen <hymie@prolifics.com>,
// archived at
//   http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=t7aeqycnze.fsf%40calumny.jyacc.com
// which bears no copyright notice, as is usual in usenet. This
// implementation descends from work GWC did in 1998, which predates
// that article; any defect here should not reflect on Hyman Rosen's
// reputation.

/// Metadata for class template mc_enum.

/// Careful attention to detail enables compile-time checking of the
/// sizes of the arrays used as non-type parameters. If too many
/// initializers are given, the compiler must emit a diagnostic
/// [8.5.1/6]. Supplying too few is acceptable [8.5.1/7] to the
/// language, but likely to cause run-time errors--which can be
/// turned into compile-time errors by the technique presented here.
///
/// Specific types require one translation unit (TU) for the
/// instantiation and a header to make them available to other TUs.
///
/// The header should define a mc_enum_key specialization that derives
/// from this struct; that requires declarations of the arrays used as
/// non-type arguments. Those array declarations must specify bounds
/// explicitly, because an array of unknown bound is an incomplete
/// type that prevents instantiation of class template mc_enum_data.
/// However, the header must not specify array initializers, because
/// including it in two TUs would violate the ODR.
///
/// The instantiation TU, however, should omit the bound specifiers,
/// causing the bounds to be 'calculated' [8.3.4/3]. Passing them as
/// non-type arguments, as '(&array)[n]' rather than as 'array[n],
/// then causes explicit instantiation to fail if the calculated
/// bounds do not match the size explicitly specified as a template
/// parameter. Limitation: this safeguard is ineffective for a TU
/// other than the instantiation TU that includes both the header and
/// the code in the accompanying '.tpp' file that implements the
/// class template, because implicit instantiation would occur; but
/// that is easily avoided in the physical design.
///
/// Because both the header and the instantiation TU require the
/// definition of the underlying enum type, that type must be defined
/// in a separate header that both these files include.
///
/// The same benefit could be realized through consistent use of a
/// macro. This built-in approach is preferred because it avoids using
/// the preprocessor and its compile-time checking is automatic.
///
/// It is contemplated that this class template will be instantiated
/// to create numerous types in one translation unit for use in other
/// translation units. Given that usage, it makes sense to instantiate
/// those types explicitly in that one translation unit, in order to
/// avoid bloat.
///
/// Implementation notes.
///
/// Array arguments are adjusted to pointers [14.1/8].
///
/// e() and c() could have been provided as static data members.
/// However, they're both pointers, so they can't be used in ICEs, in
/// particular as constant-initializers within the struct definition;
/// and writing them outside the struct definition would be balky.
///
/// 'n' could have been provided as a function rather than a constant,
/// but a constant is preferable because it can be used in an ICE. It
/// could have been an enumeration, but declaring it as a std::size_t
/// costs no more and makes its type definite and explicit.
