MAINTENANCE

Please write entries this way:

[1] YYYYMMDDTHHMMZ <yourname@domain.net> [defect-count]
[2] [this line intentionally left blank]
[3]   filename0
[4]   filename1
[5] Terse comments: full English sentences beginning with a capital
    letter and ending with a period. Prefer bare infinitives:
    "Improve ISO 8601 conformance." instead of "Improved...." or
    "The purpose of this change was to improve....". Single-word
    sentences may be appropriate: "Refactor.".

Limit lines to seventy characters so that they can be quoted and
requoted in email without wrapping.

Explanations:

[1] Write an ISO 8601 timestamp, using UTC because it sorts easily.
Run 'make check_conformity' before committing to cvs. It identifies
common problems, e.g., incorrect copyright statements.

[3] Exact name of file changed, indented two spaces.
[4] Write each file's name on a separate line. Write them in
alphabetical order.

[5] We aren't exactly following GNU standards here, but this one makes
a lot of sense:
  "If you think that a change calls for explanation, you're probably
  right. Please do explain it--but please put the explanation in
  comments in the code, where people will see it whenever they see the
  code."
If, as is often the case, the cvs commit message alone is sufficient,
then just copy it here.
