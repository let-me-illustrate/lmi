  PETE/Tools/makefile             [new file]
Import pete-2.1.1 from FreePOOMA. These files
  PETE/ErrorType.h      [not imported]
  PETE/PETETypeInfo.h   [not imported]
  PETE/Tools/include.mk [not imported]
are not imported: they are not referenced in PETE itself, and were not
present in pete-2.1.0, so presumably they are used only by POOMA. For
similar reasons, this file
  PETE/PoomaPETE.h [empty]
is imported as a zero-byte file: it is referenced in 'PETE/PETE.h, but
seems not to be used by PETE itself.

20080904T2320Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  PETE/Tools/makefile
Remove an include directive that prevented this makefile from working
in a standalone PETE context. Similarly remove a few other lines at
the top of the file. Add a POOMA license and warranty disclaimer: the
original LANL pete-2.1.0 version had the old LANL statement that has
been replaced by the POOMA statement elsewhere.

20080905T1620Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  Makefile           [new file]
  et_vector.hpp      [new file]
  et_vector.in       [new file]
  et_vector_test.cpp [new file]
Demonstrate use of PETE with std::vector.

20080906T0019Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  PETE/Tools/makefile
Repair an anomaly in target 'installheaders'. FreePOOMA has 'Tools' as
a subdirectory of 'PETE', whereas those two directories were siblings
in in LANL pete-2.1.0; therefore, 'OperatorTags.h' should now be
installed to '..'. Installing to '../PETE' creates a file named 'PETE'
in the 'PETE' directory, which is not the manifest intention. To avoid
leaving a stray copy of 'OperatorTags.h' in '/PETE/Tools', 'cp' is
replaced by 'mv' here.

20080906T0022Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  et_vector_test.cpp
Demonstrate a peteCast() anomaly. Unlike every other function object
in 'PETE/OperatorTags.h', struct 'OpCast' has an operator()() that
returns a PETE object instead of a PETE object's Type_t.

20080906T1041Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  PETE/OperatorTags.h
  PETE/Tools/PrintOperators.h
  et_vector_test.cpp
Repair peteCast() anomaly demonstrated 20080906T0022Z. Regenerate
'PETE/OperatorTags.h' by running 'make -f makefile installheaders',
then patch it manually to restore the FreePOOMA notices and the
<cmath> header (which really should be <math.h> instead).

20080906T1347Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  PETE/OperatorTags.h
Improve correctness by substituting <math.h> for <cmath>. For example,
'PETE/Tools/PeteOps.in' uses the standard C inverse cosine function:
  EXPR = "return (acos(a));"
and <math.h> declares acos(), whereas <cmath> declares std::acos().

20080907T1057Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  PETE/Tools/makefile
Do not assume that '.' is on the $PATH.

20080907T1631Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  PETE/Tools/MakeOperators.cpp
Automatically include <math.h> in '--op-tags' output.

20080907T1642Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  Makefile
Don't necessarily require g++.

20080907T1738Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  PETE/Combiners.h
  PETE/ForEach.h
  PETE/Functors.h
  PETE/PETE.h
  PETE/Scalar.h
  PETE/TreeNodes.h
  PETE/TypeComputations.h

  PETE/Tools/PrintList.h
  PETE/Tools/PrintOperators.h
  PETE/Tools/README
Remove trailing blanks once and for all. I have my editor remove them,
so doing this all at once prevents piecemeal whitespace changes.

20080908T1013Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  PETE/Tools/MakeOperators.cpp
Remove a vestige of an obsolete idea. Binary "left" operations (i.e.,
bitwise shifts '<<' and '>>') were at first treated the same as other
binary operations, but later distinguished upon introduction of macro
PETE_ALLOW_SCALAR_SHIFT. Two lines of the original non-distinguising
implementation were commented out; it is correct to remove them now
that the macro has been implemented.

20080908T1248Z <gchicares@sbcglobal.net>

  PETE/Tools/MakeOperators.cpp
  PETE/Tools/Parser.h
Remove trailing tab characters. Cf. 20080907T1738Z changes.
