/// When wx is used as an msw dll, memory is allocated and freed
/// across dll boundaries, and that caused mpatrol to emit spurious
/// diagnostics. This facility was devised to work around that
/// problem. It remains valuable although lmi no longer uses mpatrol,
/// because it indicates memory allocations that must have no matching
/// deallocations within lmi.
///
/// Build these functions as a separate shared library, and use
/// 'new(wx)' to allocate memory that will be freed by wx--e.g., a
/// frame window that's created in an application but (unavoidably)
/// freed by a wx dll.
