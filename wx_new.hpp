/// When wx is used as an msw dll, memory is allocated and freed

/// diagnostics.
///
/// To work around this problem, build these functions as a separate
/// dll, and use 'new(wx)' to allocate memory that will be freed by
/// wx--for instance, a frame window that's created in an application
/// but (unavoidably) freed by a wx dll. The sole purpose of this
/// workaround is to avoid spurious diagnostics; it is not suggested
/// that this is a good way to manage memory.
///
/// It is assumed (but not known) that no such problem occurs on other
/// platforms. Therefore, the macros above never use ELF visibility
/// attributes.
