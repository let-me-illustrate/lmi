# Limited support for Comeau C++ version 4.3.10.1, using MinGW gcc as
# the underlying C compiler, with a Cygwin shell. Comeau C++ is useful
# because it conforms to the standard in some ways that gcc does not,
# so it may reveal defects not found with gcc alone.

# SOMEDAY !! Errors may arise from template-instantiation conflicts,
# e.g., when many targets are built in the same directory. Ideas:
#  - use '-T'
#  - routinely delete '.ii' files
#  - use a monolithic library for all code shared by unit tests
#  - use a distinct subdirectory for each target
# Cf.:
# http://www-d0.fnal.gov/KAI/doc/UserGuide/faq.html#multiple_template_instance

# This is not easy because the Comeau preprocessor is not free and has
# no option like GNU cpp's '-dM' to list the macros it predefines. Yet
# it is not very important either, because Comeau C++ isn't remarkably
# different from gcc wrt conformance, so there are few conditionals to
# differentiate them and gcc dependencies work well enough for now.
