# Use file extension '.cns' for multiple-life xml documents.

# Inforce data from external systems must include 'case_default' and
# 'class_defaults'; but those elements wouldn't be expected to have
# any analogue on an administration system, so it seems best to copy
# them from this document:
#   https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lmi.git/plain/sample.cns
# overwriting its 'particular_cells' with the individual records of
# all contracts in the group.
