if you're not running ms windows.]

(1) Install Cygwin

Open a "Command Prompt" window, and enable pasting into it:

  Start | Programs | Accessories | Command Prompt
  alt-Spacebar | Properties | Options
  check both "QuickEdit Mode" and "Insert Mode"
  OK
  select "Modify shortcut that started this window"
  OK

Copy and paste the following lines into the "Command Prompt" window:

  C:
  mkdir C:\cache_for_lmi

Save the following three files into the 'C:\cache_for_lmi' directory:

  http://www.cygwin.com/setup-legacy.exe
  http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe
  http://svn.sv.nongnu.org/svn/lmi/lmi/trunk/install_cygwin.bat

Copy and paste the following lines into the "Command prompt" window:

  cd C:\cache_for_lmi
  install_cygwin >installed.txt

A messagebox warns:

  Attempt to install legacy version of Cygwin
  ---------------------------
  You are attempting to install a legacy version of Cygwin
  on a modern version of Windows.  Press "OK" if this is
  really want you want to do.  Otherwise press "Cancel".
  See http://cygwin.com/ for more information.

It may appear several times; press "OK" each time. When it finishes,
copy and paste the following line into the "Command prompt" window:

  type installed.txt

You should see something like this:

  "Anomalous 'C:\cygwin' directory present after iteration" 1
  "Anomalous 'C:\cygwin' directory present after iteration" 2
  "Cygwin 1.5 installation seems to have succeeded on iteration" 3
  "Cygwin 1.7 installation seems to have succeeded"

Close the "Command prompt" window.

(2) Install lmi

Start 'bash', and enable pasting:

  Start | Programs | Cygwin | Cygwin Bash Shell
  alt-Spacebar | Properties | Options
  check both "QuickEdit Mode" and "Insert Mode"
  OK
  select "Modify shortcut that started this window"
  OK

Copy and paste the following into 'bash':

  mkdir -p /tmp
  export TMP=/tmp
  install_script='http://svn.sv.nongnu.org/svn/lmi/lmi/trunk/install_msw.sh'
  cd /tmp
  wget -N $install_script
  chmod +x install_msw.sh
  logfile=log-`date -u +'%Y%m%dT%H%MZ'`; echo "Log file is '$logfile.tar.bz2'."
  ./install_msw.sh >$logfile 2>&1; tar -cjf $logfile.tar.bz2 $logfile

Installation proceeds silently for about an hour. When you see
"Finished building lmi", copy and paste these lines into 'bash':

  export PATH=/opt/lmi/local/bin:/opt/lmi/local/lib:$PATH
  cd /opt/lmi/bin; ./lmi_wx_shared --data_path=/opt/lmi/data

You should see lmi's GUI. Try "File | New | Illustration", then press
"OK"; you should see values. Then try "File | Print preview". You
should see an illustration in your 'pdf' viewer. But if you see
  'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file
then (for printing only) you need 'java'. You can get a version
that's been tested with lmi here:

Click "Download J2RE", then download and run this file:
  j2re-1_4_2_06-windows-i586-p.exe
