Just go here:
  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/lmi/2008-05/msg00001.html
if you're not running ms windows. Otherwise, follow the steps below:
 - either (A1) or (A2) to install Cygwin or WSL, respectively; then
 - (B) to build and run lmi.

(A1) Install Cygwin

Open a "Command Prompt" window, and enable pasting into it:

  Start | Programs | Accessories | Command Prompt
  alt-Spacebar | Properties | Options
  check both "QuickEdit Mode" and "Insert Mode"
  OK
  select "Modify shortcut that started this window"
  OK

Copy and paste the following lines into the "Command Prompt" window:

  C:
  mkdir C:\srv
  mkdir C:\srv\cache_for_lmi

Save the following files into the 'C:\srv\cache_for_lmi' directory:

  https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe
  https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lmi.git/plain/install_cygwin.bat

Copy and paste the following lines into the "Command prompt" window:

  cd C:\srv\cache_for_lmi
  install_cygwin

After a few minutes, you should see something like this at the end:

  "Cygwin installation seems to have succeeded"

Close the "Command prompt" window.

(A2) Install WSL

Open a "Windows PowerShell" window as Administrator:

  Start | Programs | Windows PowerShell | Windows PowerShell

Copy and paste the following lines into the "Windows PowerShell" window:

  New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path C:\srv\cache_for_lmi
  Set-Location -Path C:\srv\cache_for_lmi
  Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lmi.git/plain/install_wsl.ps1 -OutFile install_wsl.ps1 -UseBasicParsing
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
  Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

Agree to restart your computer.

Note: Only the last two commands need administrator privileges. So if the execution
policy already was set and Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux feature was enabled
earlier, you don't need to execute them and restart the computer (and administrator
privileges are not required either).

Open a "Windows PowerShell" window (administrator privileges are not required)
and execute the installation script:

  C:\srv\cache_for_lmi\install_wsl.ps1

Note: Only Ubuntu 18.04 is supported now because non-Debian-based OS won't work,
as we use apt, Debian and Ubuntu 16.04 uses the i686-w64-mingw32-g++ package of
lower version than required, so can't be used too.

After a few minutes, you should see something like this at the end:

  "WSL installation seems to have succeeded"

Then return back to the Restricted policy after installing
(restart "Windows PowerShell" window as Administrator to execute
this command):

  Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted

Close the "Windows PowerShell" window.

(B) Install lmi

[Experienced users: Make sure 'C:\srv\cache_for_lmi\' contains any files you
need to download manually due to corporate firewall weirdness.]

Start a Cygwin shell:

  Start | Programs | Cygwin | Cygwin Terminal

or a WSL shell:

  Start | All Programs | Apps | <Installed OS name>

Copy the following, and paste it (Shift-Insert) into the shell:

  mkdir -p /tmp
  export TMP=/tmp
  install_script='https://git.savannah.nongnu.org/cgit/lmi.git/plain/install_msw.sh'
  cd /tmp
  wget -N $install_script
  chmod +x install_msw.sh
  logfile=log_`date -u +'%Y%m%dT%H%MZ'`; echo "Log file is '$logfile.tar.xz'."
  ./install_msw.sh >$logfile 2>&1; tar -cJf $logfile.tar.xz $logfile

Installation proceeds silently for anywhere from a few minutes to a couple
of hours, depending on your computer. When you see "Finished building lmi",
copy and paste these lines into the shell:

  . /opt/lmi/src/lmi/set_toolchain.sh
  /opt/lmi/bin/lmi_wx_shared --data_path=/opt/lmi/data

You should see lmi's GUI. Try "File | New | Illustration", then press "OK";
you should see values. Then try "File | Print preview"; you should see an
illustration in your 'pdf' viewer.
