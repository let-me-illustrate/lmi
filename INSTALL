[Just go here:
  https://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/lmi/2008-05/msg00001.html
if you're not running ms windows.]

(1) Install Cygwin

Open a "Command Prompt" window, and enable pasting into it:

  Start | Programs | Accessories | Command Prompt
  alt-Spacebar | Properties | Options
  check both "QuickEdit Mode" and "Insert Mode"
  OK
  select "Modify shortcut that started this window"
  OK

Copy and paste the following lines into the "Command Prompt" window:

  C:
  mkdir C:\cache_for_lmi

Save the following files into the 'C:\cache_for_lmi' directory:

  https://cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe
  https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/lmi.git/plain/install_cygwin.bat

Copy and paste the following lines into the "Command prompt" window:

  cd C:\cache_for_lmi
  install_cygwin

After a few minutes, you should see something like this at the end:

  "Cygwin installation seems to have succeeded"

Close the "Command prompt" window.

(2) Install lmi

Start a Cygwin shell:

  Start | Programs | Cygwin | Cygwin Terminal

Copy the following, and paste it (Shift-Insert) into the shell:

  mkdir -p /tmp
  export TMP=/tmp
  install_script='https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/lmi.git/plain/install_msw.sh'
  cd /tmp
  wget -N $install_script
  chmod +x install_msw.sh
  logfile=log-`date -u +'%Y%m%dT%H%MZ'`; echo "Log file is '$logfile.tar.bz2'."
  ./install_msw.sh >$logfile 2>&1; tar -cjf $logfile.tar.bz2 $logfile

Installation proceeds silently for about an hour. When you see
"Finished building lmi", copy and paste these lines into the shell:

  export PATH=/opt/lmi/local/bin:/opt/lmi/local/lib:$PATH
  cd /opt/lmi/bin; ./lmi_wx_shared --data_path=/opt/lmi/data

You should see lmi's GUI. Try "File | New | Illustration", then press
"OK"; you should see values. Then try "File | Print preview". You
should see an illustration in your 'pdf' viewer. But if you see
  'java' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file
then (for printing only) you need 'java'. You can install a version
that's been tested with lmi by running this file:
  http://download.java.net/jdk/jre-1_5_0-windows-i586.exe
