/// first product found is not necessarily a better default than
/// "sample". Defaults hardcoded in the input class are designed to
/// be generally suitable, but might be inappropriate for some exotic
/// product. If a user creates an invalid product that appears first
/// in the list, then the system will still work in default cases
/// with "sample".
