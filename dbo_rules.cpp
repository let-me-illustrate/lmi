/// of the mcenum_dbopt enumeration. It represents an empty state
/// before the policy comes into existence. Thus, the "zero" row
/// specifies the states available upon policy issue. In this example,
/// "ROP" is entirely forbidden.
///
/// It's simplest to view this as a partitioned matrix (below), the
/// "zero" row being a special case. The square submatrix's main
/// diagonal could just as well be all 1's: "ROP" --> "ROP" is a
/// transition from a forbidden state to the same state, so it can
/// never arise anyway. But it's preferable to forbid whatever is
/// never permitted, even if it is impossible.
