/// Test selected parameters in the user-customizable default cell.

/// Run this test only when the '--distribution' option is given.
///
/// Write "ProductName" and "GeneralAccountRate" to stdout in that
/// order on a single line. We maintain several different binary
/// distributions, each with a specific default product, and that
/// product's general-account rate is a crucial parameter that often
/// varies from one month to the next, so a spot check seems wise.
///
/// The expected value of "EffectiveDate" is normally the first day
/// of the next month. (For example, to prepare a distribution that
/// is to be used beginning January first, we must run this test in
/// December, as validation should precede dissemination.)
///
/// Write both "EffectiveDate" and its expected value to stdout, both
/// as JDN and as YYYYMMDD, all on a single line, e.g.:
///   EffectiveDate: 2457024 2015-01-01  expected: 2457024 2015-01-01
/// Then print a warning on a separate line iff these two dates do not
/// match; do this after writing parameters to stdout, so that they're
/// still written even if this test abends. Inequality is an unusual
/// condition requiring attention, but not necessarily an error, so a
/// mere warning suffices; program flow should not be interrupted as
/// for an assertion failure.
