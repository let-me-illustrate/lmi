'*' and '&' are part of the type, not the name: write

# Log files.

cat >eraseme_log_000.Log <<EOF
$boilerplate
'Log' is just a suffix, distinct from the extension '.Log'; the dot in
this file's name merely avoids "camel case", which the author dislikes.
This line's length is over the limit, but...acceptable in the preamble.
MAINTENANCE
After the "MAINTENANCE" line, a strict limit applies, but this line is
just short enough. However, certain literal quotations (e.g., snippets
of code in 'DefectLog') shouldn't be wrapped artificially, so any line
quoted with an initial '|', like this:
| std::string s("I never loved a dear Gazelle--nor anything that cost me much");
is permitted, as is any line that appears to be an optionally-indented
http URL, like this:
  http://www.gnu.org/server/standards/translations/priorities.html#Languages
.
EOF

cat >eraseme_log_001.Log <<EOF
$boilerplate
The word "MAINTENANCE" is expected on a line by itself, but this file has
no such line. The 'grep' regex is "^MAINTENANCE$", so these don't suffice:
Maintenance
'MAINTENANCE'
 MAINTENANCE
and each long line preceding them elicits a diagnostic.
EOF

cat >eraseme_log_002.Log <<EOF
$boilerplate
MAINTENANCE
This line's length is at the limit, so it should elicit no diagnostic.
This line's length is slightly over the limit, so it must be diagnosed.
It is helpful to diagnose all excessively-long lines--including this one.
