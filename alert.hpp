/// Print user messages in a manner appropriate to the interface and
/// platform by writing to the std::ostreams these functions return.
/// For instance, for a command-line interface, purely informational
/// messages might be written to std::cout, and error messages to
/// std::cerr, while for a GUI, a messagebox might pop up when the
/// stream is flushed. This interface is deliberately abstract; the
/// concrete behaviors are implementation details.
///
/// Here's how the various streams are intended to be used. These
/// descriptions are generic; the implementation for each interface
/// shows specific choices made for 'lmi'.
///
/// status: Routine notifications arising in normal processing, such
/// as "file saved". They might be displayed unobtrusively in a GUI,
/// for instance on a statusbar; a command-line interface might not
/// display them at all.
///
/// warning: Significant runtime problems that should be brought to
/// the user's attention: the program can continue, but not in exactly
/// the way the user wanted, so resumption semantics are appropriate.
/// All interfaces must display a message (e.g., a GUI would typically
/// use a messagebox) but, unlike fatal_error, not routinely throw an
/// exception (unless due to internal error).
///
/// hobsons_choice: Serious runtime problems that users may be allowed
/// to bypass, though at their own peril. The 'lmi' implementation
/// happens to offer such an option only for a GUI interface; another
/// implementation might do otherwise, and no requirement is imposed
/// except that a message must be shown. A cgi-bin interface might
/// implement termination semantics, while a command-line interface
/// used only for regression testing might print a message and attempt
/// to continue.
///
/// fatal_error: Dire runtime problems that prevent the system from
/// performing a requested action in any reasonable manner, and that
/// therefore call for resumption semantics. All interfaces must show
/// a message and throw an exception when the stream is flushed. A GUI
/// might catch that exception, terminate the action in an orderly
/// way, and yet remain active, while a command-line program might
/// simply exit.
///
/// The motivation is to make code like
///   std::ostringstream oss;
///   oss << "warning: " << some_data << " is invalid";
///   oss << " in context " << some_other_data;
///   if(using_gui) messagebox(oss.str());
///   else if(using_cgi) std::cout << html_format(oss.str());
///   else ...
/// easier to write, e.g.
///   warning() << "error: " << some_data << " is invalid";
///   warning() << " in context " << some_other_data << std::flush;
///
/// Usage notes.
///
/// The 'lmi' project is gradually striving to favor fatal_error()
/// over warning() and hobsons_choice(). For temporary debugging code,
/// warning() is often useful, but production code should generally
/// avoid warning() and especially hobsons_choice(). Already, option
/// 'offer_hobsons_choice' in 'configurable_settings.?pp', if set as
/// recommended, removes the user choice from hobsons_choice().
///
/// Sometimes gcc warns of a missing return statement after the stream
/// returned by fatal_error() is flushed: an exception is obligatorily
/// thrown, but it is difficult for a compiler to discern that. When
/// (and only when) gcc issues such a warning, add exactly this line:
///   throw "Unreachable--silences a compiler diagnostic.";
/// to silence it. Rationale: a return statement would suffice, but
/// would be misleading (the function cannot return after throwing),
/// might be difficult to write (the function may return a reference),
/// and could not be everywhere identical. The throw-expression above
/// always works, is self documenting, and adds no header dependency.
/// Writing it the same way everywhere requires no invention and
/// increases global comprehensibility; see:
///   http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/lmi/2007-03/msg00008.html
///
/// Design decisions, and paths not taken.
///
/// The most important principle is to behave as std::cerr behaves:
///   std::cerr << "error" << some_variable << std::endl;
/// This suggests a std::stringbuf contained in a std::ostream that is
/// some sort of singleton. The archives of comp.lang.c++.moderated
/// show that others have used the same design.
///
/// The output destination could easily be expressed as a manipulator:
///   single_ostream << "error" << some_variable << messagebox;
/// That might be a slightly simpler design. And it is intended that an
/// exception be thrown for fatal errors at least, which seems more
/// like an independent action than a consequence of flushing a stream.
/// But following the std::cerr paradigm is the least surprising
/// approach, and it seems natural enough to emit the contents of the
/// buffer when std::flush is called.
///
/// The same example
///   single_ostream << "error" << some_variable << messagebox;
/// illustrates the decision to express the destination conceptually
/// rather than physically. A command-line program might very well pop
/// up a GUI message box, but such a feature seems unnecessary here.
/// It seems better to offer a sufficient variety of streams, a bit
/// broader than the standard output streams, and implement them for
/// each interface or platform separately. The supplied implementation
/// factors common data and operations into a base class to reduce the
/// effort required for customization.
///
/// There must be one stream object for each output type in order to
/// preserve state, accumulating successive data in a std::stringbuf
/// until it is eventually flushed. This means that these streams must
/// be initialized as some sort of singleton [but see Alexandrescu,
/// MC++D, 6.1], so cyclic initialization and destruction dependencies
/// must be avoided.
///
/// One could imagine using an optional trace file to log GUI alert
/// messages. If desired, that could be an implementation detail of the
/// GUI implementation. It would not be useful in a command-line
/// implementation, so it's not considered here. A GUI might display
/// an alert in a window with a distinct submessage in its caption, but
/// there's no natural way to express that on a command-line.
///
/// Others have written streams to log trace information for debugging.
/// That is outside the scope of this design, so no consideration is
/// given to features specific to tracing such as prefixing messages
/// with a timestamp or choosing enablement of streams at run time.
