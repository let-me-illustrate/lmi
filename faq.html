<h5><a name="how_census_blank">Why does a new census appear blank?</a></h5>
<p>
When you create a new census, it contains one cell with all input
fields set to default values. But the
<a href="group_tutorial.html#how_census_interpret">census display</a>
shows only columns that differ from their defaults, so there&rsquo;s
nothing to show except the <samp>Cell</samp> column.
</p>

<h5><a name="how_month_by_month">What&rsquo;s &ldquo;month-by-month&rdquo; processing order? Why doesn&rsquo;t it permit solves?</a></h5>
<p>
Normally every cell stands alone, and you run them one after another.
It&rsquo;s like a baton race: only one person runs at a time.
</p>
<p>
That&rsquo;s fine as long as no one&rsquo;s values depend on what
happens inside anyone else&rsquo;s contract.
But sometimes all the contracts in a group depend on each other.
That happens if fund charges are &ldquo;tiered&rdquo; by total case
assets.
For example, charges may be twenty-five basis points on the first
$1,000,000, and fifteen basis points on anything over $1,000,000.
The charges in the second month depend on the first month&rsquo;s
total account value for everyone combined.
You can&rsquo;t run each cell independently, one at a time.
You must run everyone together, one month at a time.
It can&rsquo;t be a baton race: it has to be a three-legged race.
</p>
<p>
A three-legged race can be inefficient.
Universal life uses monthly processing.
That means a lot of values have to be calculated when you run a cell.
When you run one cell at a time, <tt>lmi</tt> keeps only the year-end
values needed for printing an illustration, and throws the rest away
to save space.
But everyone&rsquo;s monthly values have to be kept when you run a
whole group one month at a time.
With a really large case, your computer may not have room for all
those numbers.
</p>
<p>
Here&rsquo;s another complication.
The first contract processed in some month might make the case&rsquo;s
assets cross from one tier into another.
That affects other contracts processed later in the same month.
<tt>lmi</tt> runs everyone in the order shown in the census.
If you change that order, you get different results.
The same thing happens in administration, too.
</p>
<p>
Running a group month by month also makes solves hard.
Suppose you want to solve for level premium to endow.
Running one cell at a time, it&rsquo;s easy.
Try one premium. If the contract doesn&rsquo;t endow, try another.
You&rsquo;ve probably done this by hand, although the computer can do
it faster.
But you can&rsquo;t isolate one contract and run its values to
maturity if they depend on the values of all other contracts.
You have to run them all together.
Imagine doing that by hand.
That&rsquo;s what makes solves hard.
If an approximation is good enough, run solves one cell at a time.
</p>

<h5><a name="how_changes_detected">Why can&rsquo;t the death benefit be decreased directly?</a></h5>
<p>
You can set the <em>specified amount</em> directly. The death benefit
may be different&mdash;for instance, because of the corridor.
</p>
<!-- TODO ?? This seems quite incorrect.
<p>
Suppose you illustrate a $1,000,000 specified amount with the
increasing death benefit option. After a few years, the death benefit
may have increased to $1,500,000. Then you might want to take a large
withdrawal and make the death benefit decrease to the original
$1,000,000.
</p>
<p>
If you set the specified amount in that year to $1,000,000, then
<tt>lmi</tt> sees that it&rsquo;s already $1,000,000, so there&rsquo;s
no change. Any other amount would be a change. If you want to get back
to the original amount, try changing it to $999,999.99.
That&rsquo;s probably close enough.
