/// Design notes for class MswDllPreloader.
///
/// This class preloads msw dlls to work around an operating-system
/// defect: some system libraries needlessly mangle the floating-point
/// control word. For instance, 'DOCPROP2.DLL' is a known offender
/// for msw '2000'.
///
/// It is implemented as a simple Meyers singleton, with the expected
/// dead-reference and threading issues.
///
/// Preloading might have been performed in the ctor; performing it in
/// member PreloadDesignatedDlls() allows the timing to be controlled.
///
/// The dtor unloads preloaded dlls in the reverse of the order in
/// which they were loaded. The data member is of type std::deque
/// in order to let this reversal be expressed more cleanly.
