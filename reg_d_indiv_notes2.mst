The definition of life insurance elected for this policy is
{{#DefnLifeInsIsGPT}}
    the guideline premium test. The guideline single premium
    is ${{InitGSP}}
    and the guideline level premium
    is ${{InitGLP}}.
{{/DefnLifeInsIsGPT}}
{{^DefnLifeInsIsGPT}}
    the cash value accumulation test.
{{/DefnLifeInsIsGPT}}
</p>

<p>
The initial 7-pay premium limit is ${{InitSevenPayPrem}}.
As illustrated, this policy
{{#IsMec}}
    fails
{{/IsMec}}
{{^IsMec}}
    passes
{{/IsMec}}
the seven-pay test defined in Section 7702A
of the Internal Revenue Code and therefore
{{#IsMec}}
    becomes a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC)
    in policy year {{MecYearPlus1}}.
{{/IsMec}}
{{^IsMec}}
    is not a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC). Subsequent changes
    to the policy, including but not limited to increases
    and decreases in premiums or benefits, may cause the policy
    to be retested and may result in the policy becoming a MEC.
{{/IsMec}}
</p>

<p>
If a policy is a MEC, withdrawals and policy loans are taxed to
the extent of any gain in the policy, and an additional penalty
tax may apply to the taxable portion of the distribution.
