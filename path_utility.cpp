/// Preserve initial path and set "native" name-checking policy for

///
/// Applications that end users would normally run should call this
/// function during initialization--before using this boost library
/// in any other way, to ensure uniform name checking (which enables
/// them to use nonportable paths, as some demand), and to make it
/// potentially possible to protect them somewhat from the strange
/// effects of inadvertent changes to the current working directory.
/// As boost's documentation notes, msw may resolve relative paths as
///   "complete( path, kinky ), where kinky is the current directory
///   for the [path's] drive. This will be the current directory of
///   that drive the last time it was set, and thus may well be
///   residue left over from some prior program run by the command
///   processor! Although these semantics are often useful, they are
///   also very error-prone, and certainly deserve to be called
///   'kinky'."
/// although it's unclear whether there's any way to get msw to do
/// this exactly when end users desire it and not otherwise.
///
/// MSYS !! Call this function during initialization for any program
/// that could be passed a path argument, even if the argument is a
/// portable path, because MSYS's bash translates it to a nonportable
/// one. For example, if this function isn't called, then
///   --data_path='/opt/lmi/data'
/// engenders this diagnostic:
///   boost::filesystem::path: [line split for readability]
///     invalid name "C:" in path: "C:/msys/1.0/opt/lmi/data"
///
/// This function is not called in the initialization routine used by
/// all programs, because simple command-line tools should not be
/// forced to depend on this boost library.
///
/// Resist the urge to write its simple implementation inline because
/// that may fail with gcc on msw--see:
///   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.mingw.user/18633
///     [2006-01-14T11:55:49Z from Greg Chicares]
///
/// The boost documentation says:
///   "The preferred implementation would be to call initial_path()
///   during program initialization, before the call to main().
///   This is, however, not possible with changing the C++ runtime
///   library."
/// One could wish that they had expressed that in code instead of
/// commentary: std::cout manages to work this way by using the
/// so-called "nifty counter" technique, which perhaps ought to be
/// used here.
