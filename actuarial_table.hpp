/// Reentry methods for select tables.
///
/// Reentry occurs only on anniversary.
///
/// At least in the present implementation, illustrations reflect
/// reentry only retrospectively, because future reentry is subject to
/// qualification. Furthermore, it is assumed in general that only the
/// most recent reentry is known and earlier history is unavailable.
/// Therefore, reentry occurs at most once, and it is handled by
/// transforming the arguments of the raw table-lookup functions.
///
/// Important note: These transformations take the general form
///   map [A]+B to [C]+D
/// it being understood that a table's age limits must be respected:
/// if C would violate that constraint, then
///   [C+Z]+D-Z
/// is used instead, where Z (unconstrained as to sign) is chosen so
/// that [C+Z] is the closest permissible select age.
///
/// Let
///   CD = contract date
///   SD = [re]illustration date, CD <= SD
///   RD = last group reset date, RD <= SD [see stricter limit below]
/// where RD may in general precede, follow, or coincide with CD. Let
/// reillustration duration be
///   s = floor  (years by which SD follows CD), 0 <= s
/// and let contract reset duration be
///   r = ceiling(years by which RD follows CD), r <= s
///         (or years by which RD precedes CD, giving a negative r)
/// which latter imposes a stricter limit on RD, viz.
///   RD <= CD + s
/// (Durations are measured from CD because the absolute value of the
/// integral number of years between two dates depends on which is
/// taken as the base for calculation.) Let
///   x = insurance age
///   j = projection duration as measured from CD + s, 0 <= j
/// so the first rate actually used is for projection duration j = 0.
///
/// e_reenter_never
///   map [x]+s+j to [x]+s+j [the identity mapping]
/// This is the default behavior.
///
/// e_reenter_at_inforce_duration
///   map [x]+s+j to [x+s]+j
/// Use this method when rates are deemed to reset each year, but
/// illustrations are to reflect reentry only retrospectively, e.g.,
/// because no future reset is guaranteed.
///
/// e_reenter_upon_rate_reset
///   map [x]+s+j to [x+r]-r+s+j
/// Use this method when rates were reset on a specified date, but
/// illustrations are to reflect reentry only retrospectively, e.g.,
/// because no future reset is guaranteed. Certificates issued on
/// divers dates may share a common group reset date that need not
/// coincide with a certificate anniversary; in that case, rates reset
/// on the next certificate anniversary following or coincident with
/// the group reset date: i.e., on
///   CD + r
/// As the same case makes clear, there can be no lower limit on the
/// reset date: it can even precede a group insured's date of birth.
///
/// All three methods are affected by the "Important note" above: even
/// e_reenter_never, if [x] exceeds max_select_age_ (see documentation
/// for specific_values()). Furthermore, for all three methods, rates
/// for attained ages in the half-open interval [x, x+s) would not be
/// used because they correspond to policy years preceding the year of
/// [re]illustration, and are indeterminate because reentry history is
/// not plenary (only the most recent reentry is known). Indeterminate
/// rates may come from a table (yet be of uncertain applicability for
/// lack of history); or they may be set to zero, or to any other
/// value such as QNaN.
///
/// These methods are designed for select-and-ultimate tables. For
/// attained-age tables, they are all equivalent wrt all values that
/// are not documented above as indeterminate.
