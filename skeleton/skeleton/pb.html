This is a derived work based on wxWindows file
  samples/html/printing/test.htm
which bears no copyright or license notice but is part of the
wxWindows library and appears to be the work of Vaclav Slavik.

The original was modified by GWC in 2003 to test html page breaks;
I believe I submitted it to wxWindows as part of my page-break patch.
It was further modified by GWC in 2004 to add these copyright and
license notices, and to validate as html 4.01 (transitional).
