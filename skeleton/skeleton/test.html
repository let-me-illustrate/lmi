This is a derived work based on wxWindows file
  samples/html/printing/test.htm
which bears no copyright or license notice but is part of the
wxWindows library and appears to be the work of Vaclav Slavik.

The original was modified by GWC in 2003 to test html page breaks;
I believe I submitted it to wxWindows as part of my page-break patch.
It was further modified by GWC in 2004 to add these copyright and
license notices, and to validate as html 4.01 (transitional).

HTML itself lacks page breaks, but CSS2 supports them with
<tt>&lt;div style="page-break-before:always"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</tt>.
Such page breaks affect only printing, not normal viewing.
To see them, use 'File | Print preview' or 'File | Print' in the
included sample application, or in an HTML browser that supports
this CSS2 tag.

<p>AAA [page break follows]</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
<p>BBB [this should be at the top of a new page]</p>
<p>There is no page break here.</p>
<p>CCC [page break follows]</p>
<div style="page-break-before:always"></div>
<p>DDD [this should be at the top of a new page]</p>

<p><b>Boldface.</b></p>
<p><i>Italic.</i></p>
<p><u>Underlined.</u></p>
<p><b><i><u>Boldface, italic, and underlined.</u></i></b></p>

<p>Graphics can be embedded. This HTML has been validated,
so we can use this w3c icon:
<img border="0" src="valid-html401.png" height="31" width="88" alt="valid-html graphic">
</p>

</body>
