/// Why another timer class?
///
/// Boost provides a timer class, but they deliberately chose to use
/// only a low-resolution timer. Their rationale is apparently that
/// high-resolution timers may be more precise than they are accurate,
/// and that latency is a significant concern. This class uses a high-
/// resolution timer if available; it's a sharp tool that lets you
/// make your own decision about that rationale.

/// Time an operation over an actively-adjusted number of repetitions.
///
/// Adjust the number of repetitions measured, balancing expenditure
/// of time against accuracy. Motivation: it is often useful to time
/// an operation in unit tests, but unit tests should run quickly even
/// on slow machines or in high-overhead debugging modes.
///
/// Start by executing the operation once. If that takes longer than
/// the limit specified, then record that single observation and exit.
/// Rationale: if it is desired to spend up to one second testing an
/// operation, but the operation takes ten seconds, then the desired
/// limit has already been exceeded tenfold, and the value of one more
/// observation does not justify doubling that harm.
///
/// Otherwise, discard the first observation (which is often anomalous
/// due, e.g., to cache effects); execute the operation repeatedly,
/// until the stopping criterion is satisfied; and then record the
/// minimum measured time, which is more useful than the mean--see:
///   http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/lmi/2017-05/msg00005.html
/// The stopping criterion is that both:
///  - at least one percent of the allotted time has been spent; and
///  - either all allotted time has been used, or the repetition count
///      has reached one hundred.
///
/// The rationale for stopping after one hundred repetitions is that
/// continuing is generally unlikely to increase accuracy. Consider
/// timing an operation that takes one millisecond, with a (default)
/// limit of one second: one million repetitions would seem excessive.
///
/// The rationale for not stopping until at least one percent of the
/// allotted time has been spent is that this has been observed to
/// increase accuracy for operations that take very little time.
///
/// Template parameter 'F' is the type of the first ctor parameter,
/// which either is a nullary function or behaves like one. A facility
/// such as std::bind() is useful for reducing the arity of the
/// argument (see unit test). Naturally, this is subject to the
/// Forwarding Problem, but that's inherent in the language.
///
/// Ctor parameter 'max_seconds' is the desired limit on measurement
/// time, in seconds.
///
/// This class template is a friend of class Timer so that it can
/// access Timer::frequency_, which should not have a public accessor
/// because its type is platform dependent.
///
/// Implicitly-declared special member functions do the right thing.
