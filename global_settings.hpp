/// Design notes for class global_settings.
///
/// This is a simple Meyers singleton, with the expected threading and
/// dead-reference issues.
///
/// Data members, in logical rather than alphabetical order:
///
/// mellon_: 'Home-office' password given--enable some fancy features.
/// (LOTR: 'pedo mellon a minno'.)
///
/// ash_nazg_: 'One password to rule them all' given--enable everything
/// 'mellon' does (by forcing the latter member's value), along with
/// other features--some of which may be experimental or perilous.
/// (LOTR: 'ash nazg durbatulûk'.)
///
/// pyx_: Enable experimental behaviors that vary from time to time.
///
/// custom_io_0_: Special input and output facility for one customer.
///
/// regression_testing_: Enable special behaviors needed for regression
/// testing. For instance, allow test cases to run even in states that
/// haven't approved a product, because it is important to test new
/// products before approval.
///
/// data_directory_: Path to data files.
///
/// Directory members, whose names end in 'directory_', are stored as
/// filesystem path objects because that is their nature. They are
/// accessed as such in order to make misuse more difficult. But they
/// are set from std::string objects, because that is a natural way to
/// store them e.g. in xml files, and because that enables 'set_'
/// functions to validate their arguments.
