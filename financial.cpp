/// Possibly off-anniversary premium to be shown on list bill.
///
/// Motivation: Group UL certificates may be issued on any date, but
/// plan sponsors want to pay for all certificates on the same date.
///
/// Calculate a certificate's discounted premium for a billing cycle,
/// during which a certificate anniversary might occur and insurance
/// age might therefore change. The billing interval is any of the
/// customary life-insurance payment modes. For the maximum billing
/// period of one year, the demographic notation used on page 129 of
/// Batten, _Mortality Table Construction_, 1978 (ISBN 0-13-601302-3)
/// would be:
///   - (delta)premium(x)   [here, prem_ante] for monthly charges at
///     age x from the bill date to the anniversary age change;
///   - (alpha)premium(x+1) [here, prem_post] for monthly charges at
///     age x+1 from the anniversary age change to the end of the
///     billing year (zero if the certificate matures at age x+1).
/// Construct a monthly vector of delta or alpha premiums as the
/// case may be, then discount them, at an interest rate given as
/// v upper twelve, for the period defined by the given mode.
///
/// Return the discounted value, which is to be rounded by the caller.
///
/// Implementation notes:
///  - p0 is a vector of premiums, one for each month in the billing
///    cycle: zero or more delta values, followed by zero or more
///    alpha values.
///  - v is a vector of discount factors v12^0, v12^1, v12^2... .
