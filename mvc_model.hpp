/// Design notes for class MvcModel.
///
/// Names() gives the names by which Model entities are accessed.
///
/// State() maps each element of Names() to a string representation of
/// its current value; this constitutes the Model's current state.
///
/// AdaptExternalities() updates objects outside this class to reflect
/// its state.
///
/// CustomizeInitialValues() facilitates dynamic initialization. As a
/// motivating example, consider a derived class with calendar-date
/// members whose values are interdependent. Its ctor can easily
/// hardcode an indubitably-valid initial state, but it may be more
/// natural to use the current date for one particular member; yet
/// duplicating the Harmonize() and Transmogrify() logic in its ctor
/// is a poor way to make the other members consistent. It is better
/// to perform any dynamic customization of initial values in the
/// overridden virtual this function calls, then to make everything
/// consistent in this nonvirtual function if possible, and finally to
/// verify in TestInitialConsistency() that the resulting state is
/// consistent and stable.
///
/// EnforceCircumscription() changes a range-constrained numeric
/// value, if necessary, to ensure that it lies between its limits.
///
/// EnforceProscription() changes an enumerative value, if necessary
/// and possible, to one that is allowed.
///
/// EnforceCircumscription() and EnforceProscription() are intended to
/// be called by Transmogrify(). They are distinct functions in order
/// to permit selective overriding of implementation while enforcing
/// invocation order. Generally, range limits and allowable control
/// items are changed in Harmonize() only, and forced changes occur
/// only in Transmogrify() or in functions like these that it calls.
///
/// Harmonize() and Transmogrify() both enforce various relationships
/// among data and their associated controls. Harmonize() updates
/// range limits and conditional enablement, but does not affect the
/// value of any datum. Transmogrify() changes data values as required
/// to enforce consistency. Neither directly changes any control, of
/// course: that's the Controller's job. Harmonize() is notionally
/// const in that it must not change any datum's value--a condition
/// that is tested carefully, and engenders an exception if violated.
/// It cannot be physically const without making UDT members (other
/// than the UDT's value) mutable, which they must not be because they
/// affect the UDT's state, as observable by equality comparison or,
/// often, by mere inspection of the View.
///
/// Reconcile() calls Harmonize() and Transmogrify() one or more
/// times, until neither changes any data member's value.
///
/// TODO ?? Is that actually sufficient? Shouldn't the stopping
/// criterion be more stringent? Why not require that iteration
/// continue until no data member changes in any way?
///
/// TestInitialConsistency() ensures that the initial state is valid
/// and stable--stability meaning idempotence under the operations
/// performed by Reconcile(). In the MVC framework, it is invoked by
/// the Controller's ctor. It might seem more natural for the Model's
/// ctor to invoke it, but that would pose two problems:
///
///  - because it can throw, defining any Model object at namespace
///    scope would be perilous--the exception it uses to report any
///    problems it diagnoses would not be caught, so the program would
///    simply abend; and
///
///  - because it necessarily calls virtual member functions, it would
///    need to be invoked by the derived class's ctor--but that's the
///    classic postconstructor problem, which has no tidy solution.
///
/// The first problem is at least alleviated, and the second solved in
/// the best way, by invoking this function once in the Controller's
/// ctor instead of hoping that the author of every concrete Model
/// class remembers to do so and avoids defining any Model object at
/// namespace scope.
///
/// Implicitly-declared special member functions do the right thing.
