// Gregory W. Chicares modified it in 2004 to make it independent of
// the boost directory structure, and in any other ways indicated
// below, and in any later years shown above. Any defect in it should
// not reflect on Beman Dawes's reputation.

// The original boost.org test library upon which this derived work is
// based was later replaced by a very different library. That new test
// library has more features but is less transparent; it is not
// strictly compatible with tests written for the original library;
// and, for boost-1.31.0 at least, it didn't work out of the box with
// the latest como compiler. The extra features don't seem to be worth
// the cost.
//
// It seems unwise to mix boost versions, and better to extract this
// library from boost-1.23.0 and remove its dependencies on other
// parts of boost, which is easy to do because, as Beman Dawes says:
// Header dependencies are deliberately restricted to reduce coupling.

    // The intent is to propose the following for addition to namespace std
    // in the C++ Standard Library, and to then deprecate EXIT_SUCCESS and
    // EXIT_FAILURE.  As an implementation detail, this header defines the
    // new constants in terms of EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE.  In a new
    // standard, the constants would be implementation-defined, although it
    // might be worthwhile to "suggest" (which a standard is allowed to do)
    // values of 0 and 1 respectively.

    // Rationale for having multiple failure values: some environments may
    // wish to distinguish between different classes of errors.
    // Rationale for choice of values: programs often use values < 100 for
    // their own error reporting.  Values > 255 are sometimes reserved for
    // system detected errors.  200/201 were suggested to minimize conflict.
