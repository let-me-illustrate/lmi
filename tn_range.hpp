/// Design notes for class template trammel_base.
///
/// Abstract class trammel_base encapsulates range limits. Classes
/// derived from it are intended to be used only with class template
/// tn_range, to which it grants friendship; having only private
/// members, it cannot be used otherwise.
///
/// If range limits were always integral, then they might have been
/// implemented as non-type template parameters, but floating-point
/// limits are important and often must assume non-integral values, as
/// for interest rates.
///
/// If range limits were always constant, then they might have been
/// implemented as static data or function members. However, limits
/// often must vary depending on dynamic context, so virtual behavior
/// is required.
///
/// Floating-point limits must be adjusted. Given
///   double const z = 1.07;
/// 2.13.3/1 permits any ordering of {z, 1.07} and doesn't require
/// that they be equal, so a range type restricted to [0.0, 1.07]
/// might, if naively implemented, deem 1.07 to be an invalid value.
/// The present implementation prevents that problem by adjusting the
/// nominal minimum and maximum downward and upward, respectively, by
/// a factor of one plus epsilon.
///
/// Private pure virtuals provide the nominal limits and a default
/// value. Public nonvirtuals forward the default value and adjust the
/// nominal limits. Performing that adjustment in this class ensures
/// that it always takes place, the unadjusted limits being externally
/// inaccessible.
///
/// This class also provides a function asserting the postcondition
///   nominal_minimum() <= default_value() <= nominal_maximum()
/// which should be called in the most-derived object's ctor. This is
/// the classic postconstructor problem:
///   http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.c++.moderated/msg/80ab79d85b150e17
/// which has no tidy general solution. If a maintainer later adds
/// another ctor to class template tn_range, or uses a class derived
/// from class template trammel_base in an unanticipated way, then the
/// postcondition could be violated, but only if the separate mistake
/// of writing limits that are actually inconsistent is also made.

/// as type double, not as the actual type used in a derived class.
/// The motivation is to allow a GUI application to set the limits of,

/// Range-limited controls in wx generally have limits of type int;
/// type double is used here for greater generality.

/// Design notes for class template tn_range.
///
/// Class tn_range encapsulates a numeric value with upper and lower
/// bounds. Attempting to construct, copy, or assign a value outside
/// the bounded range sets the tn_range object's value to the closest
/// bound. Limits may be altered dynamically subject to
///   nominal_minimum() <= minimum() <= maximum() <= nominal_maximum()
/// where all four quantities are adjusted as in class trammel_base.
///
/// This class is intended primarily for use with GUI input. To assist
/// clients in validating input, limits can be queried, and candidate
/// values tested for conformity with the allowed range. Generally,
/// it is desirable not to let input enter an invalid state, so the
/// value-changing semantics are preferable to throwing an exception.
/// Accordingly, the invariant
///   minimum() <= value() <= maximum()
/// is maintained as a postcondition by all member functions save only
/// those that set the minimum or maximum explicitly: those member
/// functions forbear to modify the value in order to respect the MVC
/// Model's separation of operations that mutate the value (performed
/// in MvcModel::Transmogrify()) from those that do not (performed in
/// MvcModel::Harmonize()).
///
/// As an alternative considered but rejected, the minimum() and
/// maximum() mutators might have been made private. It would suffice
/// to offer only minimum_and_maximum(), which is more robust, as its
/// documentation explains. Consider, though:
///
///    // Minimum and maximum ages must not be permitted to cross.
///    age_minimum.minimum_and_maximum
///        (age_minimum.trammel().minimum_minimorum()
///        ,age_maximum.value()
///        );
///    age_maximum.minimum_and_maximum
///        (age_minimum.value()
///        ,age_maximum.trammel().maximum_maximorum()
///        );
///
/// Requiring defaults to be spelled out makes the code less clear and
/// novel mistakes more likely, particularly because the defaults bear
/// no actual information. This straightforward implementation:
///
///    // Minimum and maximum ages must not be permitted to cross.
///    age_minimum.maximum(age_maximum.value());
///    age_maximum.minimum(age_minimum.value());
///
/// is far clearer, and, under the assumption that the a priori
/// minimum minimorum and maximum maximorum are always suitable, not
/// vulnerable to the problem that minimum_and_maximum() is designed
/// to solve. OTOH, this example:
///
///    // This thing has a minimum.
///    age.minimum(age_minimum.value());
///    // Oh, and it has a maximum, too.
///    age.maximum(age_maximum.value());
///    // Hope the minimum and maximum don't cross!
///
/// is far better written as:
///
///    // This thing has a limited range.
///    age.minimum_and_maximum(age_minimum.value(), age_maximum.value());
///
/// Implementation notes for class template tn_range.
///
/// It is contemplated that this class template will be instantiated
/// to create numerous types in a single translation unit for use in
/// other translation units. Given that usage, it makes sense to
/// instantiate those types explicitly in that single translation
/// unit, in order to avoid bloat.
///
/// Range limits are held in a template class that is specified as a
/// template argument; the implementation enforces the requirement
/// that it be derived from class template trammel_base. Different
/// 'trammel' template classes can be instantiated from the same class
/// template for different numeric types--for instance, to create
/// distinct integer and floating-point percentage UDTs that are
/// constrained to an equivalent [0%, 100%] range.
///
/// The implicitly-defined copy ctor and copy assignment operator do
/// the right thing.
