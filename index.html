<h2>
Let me illustrate&hellip;
</h2>

<p>
<tt>lmi</tt> is a
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a>
life-insurance illustration system designed to make product
implementation quick and easy.
</p>

<p>
Complicated products like variable UL have many moving parts, but the
parts are almost always generic, and the way they work together is
essentially identical across the industry. For example, one
product&rsquo;s current policy fee may be higher or lower than
another&rsquo;s. It might vary by duration, or even by issue state.
But, even though its value varies, its behavior is standardized:
it&rsquo;s highly likely to be deducted at the beginning of
monthiversary processing. Specifying a UL product these days is pretty
much a matter of specifying a large but finite set of parameters.
</p>

<p>
Given that products are parametric variations on a few common themes,
how should their differences be expressed in an illustration system?
You may have worked with other programs that put product differences
into their source code. The drawback is that implementing a new
product or updating an old one requires programming. That&rsquo;s
bound to take time and money. Specifications need to be written. Code
needs to be tested. Misunderstandings can arise.
</p>

<p>
<tt>lmi</tt>, on the other hand, segregates all product differences
into external files that you don&rsquo;t have to be a programmer to
change. Its source code doesn&rsquo;t need to be touched unless a
product has some novel feature that hasn&rsquo;t been programmed yet,
and even in that case the feature only has to be coded and tested
once. Otherwise, implementing a product is simply a matter of
specifying its rates and rules in <tt>lmi</tt>&rsquo;s product editor,
without modifying the program.
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s an example&mdash;a guaranteed premium load of 5% in the
first year, 3.5% for the next three years, and 2% thereafter:
</p>

<p>
<img src="guar_prem_load.png" width="547" height="366" alt="[screenshot]">
</p>

<p>
This particular load applies only up to the target premium. The next
parameter in the tree on the left-hand side is the corresponding load
on premium in excess of target. These guaranteed parameters have
current analogs. There are <i>refundable</i> variants as well, to
support products that refund a portion of premium loads upon early
surrender.
</p>

<p>
Some parameters are rates; others are rules. For example, suppose you
offer a preferred class only to nonsmokers, and don&rsquo;t allow it
for simplified or guaranteed issue. Here&rsquo;s how you enter that in
the <tt>lmi</tt> product editor:
</p>

<p>
<img src="allow_preferred.png" width="754" height="381" alt="[screenshot]">
</p>

<p>
<i>[We&rsquo;ll widen the underwriting-basis field.]</i>
</p>

<p>
That rule doesn&rsquo;t just prevent calculating preferred-smoker
values. It also controls GUI input. If a user has selected the
preferred class for a nonsmoker&hellip;
</p>

<p>
<img src="preferred_nonsmoker.png" width="588" height="153" alt="[screenshot]">
</p>

<p>
&hellip;and then chooses smoker instead&hellip;
</p>

<p>
<img src="standard_smoker.png" width="588" height="153" alt="[screenshot]">
</p>

<p>
&hellip;then preferred is grayed out, and the class is forced to standard.
</p>

<p>
Everything that distinguishes one product from another is expressed in
external product-database files with a couple hundred editable
parameters. Other external files let you extensively customize the
layout and contents of input screens and printed reports;
documentation for these features will be added later.

<h2><a name="#OtherUses">Other uses</a></h2>

<p>
<tt>lmi</tt> has been used in production since 1998 as an illustration
system, but it has other uses.
</p>

<p>
<b>Illustrating a product while it&rsquo;s being developed.</b>
Often it&rsquo;s useful to see how a sales concept works, without
waiting for a vendor or a systems department to implement the product.
But profit-testing systems usually provide only rudimentary ledgers.
Product-development staff will probably find <tt>lmi</tt> comfortably
similar to their profit-testing software&mdash;after all, it was
designed by a product-development actuary. They can use <tt>lmi</tt>
to test illustration scenarios at any stage of pricing. Once a product
design is final, illustrations can be produced immediately.
That&rsquo;s helpful when agents are clamoring for specimen
illustrations before a system is rolled out.
</p>

<p>
<b>Producing product specifications.</b>
<tt>lmi</tt>&rsquo;s database files contain all the rates and rules
needed for illustrations. These files can be printed as flat text.
Using <tt>lmi</tt> as a specification engine is easier than writing
narrative specifications. Parameters are presented in a uniform
format, so if you want to see how two similar products differ, you can
use a side-by-side file-comparison tool to compare the text output.
</p>

<p>
<b>Validating another illustration system.</b>
We&rsquo;ve used <tt>lmi</tt> to test several other systems. Usually,
vendors won&rsquo;t show us their source code, so we send them
<tt>lmi</tt>&rsquo;s monthly account-value rollforward report for
every mismatching test case. That&rsquo;s easier than going back and
forth with hand calculations.
</p>

<p>
<b>Validating an administration system.</b>
Illustration systems typically credit interest as though every month
had the same number of days, so they can&rsquo;t match an
administration system&rsquo;s values exactly. To address that problem,
<tt>lmi</tt> optionally reflects the exact number of days in each month.
</p>

<h2><a name="Contributing">Contributing</a></h2>

<p>
Many people at many insurance companies have created ad-hoc systems
to fill needs that <tt>lmi</tt> meets. These systems typically are
written in haste, not peer reviewed, not rigorously tested, and often
maintainable only by their authors. Why not combine our efforts, so we
can all have something better at less cost? Contact the

principal author</a> if you&rsquo;d like to help.
</p>

<h2><a name="Present">Present limitations</a></h2>

<p>
Today, <tt>lmi</tt> is used in production for numerous general- and
separate-account UL products in the BOLI, high net worth, and
group UL markets. Naturally, it&rsquo;s most complete and
best tested in the areas where it&rsquo;s been deployed. But
I&rsquo;ve developed other types of products in prior decades, and
have taken care to design <tt>lmi</tt> for extensibility. For example,
changing the program to illustrate an annuity product took only a few
days.
