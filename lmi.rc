// To make msw use this:
AAAAAAAA ICON "lmi.ico"
// as the application's icon e.g. for 'explorer', make sure it's both
// the first icon alphabetically and the first defined in the resource
// file, for reasons explained here:
//   http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a825ce%244iqj%241%40as201.hinet.hr
// On the msw platform, this icon must be embedded in the application
// binary. Other icons are treated the same way here, not because they
// must be, but simply as a matter of consistency and convenience.

// Get stock cursors etc. Unconventionally, write this #include
// directive at the end of this file, to prevent any ICON statements
// in the included file from preceding the application's icon--which
// would be bad for reasons explained above.
//
#include <wx/msw/wx.rc>
