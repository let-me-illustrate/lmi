/// Determine specamt from GLP or GSP.
///
/// This class exists for the sole purpose of determining specamt from
/// a premium taken as the GLP or GSP. Target premium is the essential
/// complication: it depends on specamt, and different products set it
/// in such different ways that it's best established by calling into
/// an instance of class BasicValues. There's no other irreducible
/// dependency between that class and class Irc7702, so it's best to
/// keep them separate except for this special-purpose accouplement.
///
/// The physical rationale is to group several functions together so
/// that they can easily be made friends of class Irc7702. Although
/// it's unusual for all members of a class to be static functions,
/// the other options are worse. Befriending multiple free functions
/// would introduce their argument types (including class BasicValues)
/// into class Irc7702. Friendship could be avoided by adding numerous
/// public accessors to class Irc7702, but would increase complexity
/// and weaken encapsulation. And inheritance would just be wrong.
